Apoptotic osteoclasts generate large amounts of apoptotic bodies (ABs) marking the end of the bone resorption phase, whereas the functions of osteoclast-derived ABs remain largely unknown. Here, we identified the molecular profile of ABs derived from osteoclasts at distinct differentiation stages and investigated their corresponding functions. ABs were isolated from apoptotic bone marrow macrophages, preosteoclasts, and mature osteoclasts induced by staurosporine. Proteomic signature analysis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry suggested marked protein cargo differences among the different ABs. Further bioinformatic analysis showed that the proteomic signatures of the ABs were highly similar to those of their parental cells. Functionally, pOC-ABs induced endothelial progenitor cell differentiation and increased CD31(hi)Emcn(hi) endothelial cell formation in a murine bone defect model via their PDGF-BB cargo. mOC-ABs induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and facilitated osteogenesis via RANKL reverse signaling. In summary, we mapped the detailed proteomic landscapes of ABs derived from osteoclasts and showed that their potential biological roles are important in coupling bone formation with resorption during bone remodeling.","2021-01-11","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:04","5","","1","9","","Bone Res.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 12 Place: London Publisher: Springernature Web of Science ID: WOS:000607154400001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\9JSEVKQP\Ma et al. - 2021 - Osteoclast-derived apoptotic bodies couple bone re.pdf","","","ANGIOGENESIS; CELL; DIFFERENTIATION; EXOSOMES; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; MECHANISMS; MICROVESICLES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In bone turn over, at the end of bone resorption phase, most osteoclasts undergo apoptosis, generating large amounts of ABs. However, it remains unclear of the role of osteoclast-derived ABs in bone remodeling. Methods: Staurosporine (STS) was used to apoptotic induction and differential centrifugation was used to isolate ABs. Western blotting, flowcytometry and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed for ABs identification, while whole transcriptome of ABs from osteoclasts at different stages was detected by RNA-seq. VENN analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed to compare the profile similarities between ABs and parental cells. In vitro efficacy of ABs on angiogenesis and osteogenesis were evaluated by tube formation assay and ALP staining. In vivo, calvarial defect mice model was used to assess the effects of ABs-modified decalcified bone matrix (DBM) scaffolds on angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Results: Here we mapped the whole transcriptome paralleled with small RNA profiling of osteoclast derived ABs at distinct differentiation stages. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed significant differences in RNA signatures among the ABs generated from osteoclasts at different stages. By comparing with parental osteoclast RNA profiles, we found that the transcriptome of ABs exhibited high similarities with the corresponding parental cells. Functionally, in vitro and in vivo studies showed that similar with the parental cells, pOC-ABs potentiated endothelial progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, whereas mOC-ABs promoted osteogenic differentiation. The inherited biological effects of ABs were shown mediated by several enriched IncRNAs of which the interference abolished AB functions. Conclusions: Our study revealed the total RNA profiles of osteoclast derived ABs and demonstrated their biological functions. Both gene set and functional analysis indicated that osteoclast derived ABs are biologically similar with the parental cells suggesting their bridging role in osteoclast-osteoblast coupling in bone remodeling.","2020","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:04","6825-6838","","15","10","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 14 Place: Lake Haven Publisher: Ivyspring Int Publ Web of Science ID: WOS:000569093500006","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\S9F3HPAJ\Ma et al. - 2020 - Osteoclast-derived apoptotic bodies show extended .pdf","","","ANGIOGENESIS; Apoptotic body; Bone remodeling; Cell coupling; CLEARANCE; DIFFERENTIATION; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; EXOSOMES; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; LIGAND; MECHANISMS; MEDIATORS; MICROPARTICLES; Osteoclast; Vesicle bioinformatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we discover that AB-null MRL/lpr mice show resistance to breast cancer cell implantation, with more CD8+ T cell infiltrations and a higher survival rate. We uncover that the membranous Siglec15 on osteoclast-derived ABs binds with sialylated Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and blocks downstream co -stimulatory signaling, leading to the inhibition of naive CD8+ T cell activation. In addition, our study shows that treatment with Siglec15 neutralizing antibodies significantly reduces the incidence of secondary metastases and improves the survival rate of mice with advanced breast cancer bone metastasis.

Study Design: Electron microscopic study of the response of rats to a controlled bone injury, and a randomized controlled study of the effect of IL-1 beta administered continuously for three days. Methods: A standardized defect (1.1 millimeter in diameter, 0.5 millimeter deep) was created unilaterally on the anteromedial surface of the tibia. In some animals, the injury site was recovered five days after operation and processed for ultrastructural evaluation of osteoblasts in the callus. In another group, IL-1 beta was delivered to the bone defect using micro-osmotic pumps (0.5 nanograms/hour); control rats received vehicle only. The bones were recovered one to fourteen days after injury, and concentrations of proliferating cells, osteoblasts, and apoptotic bodies were determined. The amount of callus that formed in the defect was measured. Results: Osteoblasts in the callus exhibited ultrastructural changes characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis, including condensation of chromatin, membrane blebbing, formation of apoptotic bodies, and phagocytosis by nearby osteoblasts. Addition of IL-1 beta significantly increased the number of osteobIasts at the injury site and significantly decreased the number of apoptotic bodies in relation to the number of osteoblasts. The amount of callus in the bone defect was not affected by IL-1 beta treatment. Conclusion: The role of programmed cell death of osteobIasts as a normal concomitant of bone healing was confirmed. Evidence was found suggesting that IL-1 beta mediated the appearance and disappearance of osteoblasts, possibly by affecting the rates of differentiation and apoptosis, respectively. Understanding these mechanisms conceivably could lead to the ability to control osteoblast levels at an injury site.","1999-07","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:04","356-362","","5","13","","J.

However, the biological roles of osteoclast-derived ABs (OC-ABs) in bone remodeling have not been investigated and remain unknown. In this study, we stimulated bone marrow macrophages with receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand (RANKL) to obtain both preosteoclasts and mature osteoclasts (mOCs). We then used alendronate to induce apoptosis in preosteoclasts and mOCs and generate the respective ABs and used flow cytometry and immunoblotting to characterize the sizes and immunogenic characteristics of the extracted ABs. We show that mOC-ABs are engulfed by preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and promote the viability of these cells. Among all osteoclast-derived extracellular vesicles, mOC-ABs had the highest osteogenic potency. We further observed that mOC-ABs had the highest vesicular receptor activator of NF-kappa B (RANK) levels among all types of osteoclast-derived extracellular vesicles. Of note, masking of vesicular RANK by soluble RANKL strongly abolished the osteogenic potency of osteoclast-derived ABs. Mechanistically, we found that mOC-ABs induce osteoblast differentiation by activatingPI3K/AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase signaling. In conclusion, OC-ABs promote osteogenic differentiation by stimulating osteoblast differentiation via activation of RANKL reverse signaling. These findings provide important insights into the reversal phase between the bone resorption and formation stages during bone remodeling and identify an AB-dependent cellular signaling mechanism in osteoclast-osteoblast coupling.","2019-07-19","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:04","11240-11247","","29","294","","J.

The injury-induced apoptotic component of the healing response was shifted in time due to the combined cytokines, compared with vehicle only, with the result that the peak in the concentration of apoptotic bodies occurred 2-3 days earlier in the treated animals. Neither osteoprogenitor proliferation nor osteoblast concentration was affected by addition of the cytokines. The results suggested that activation of apoptosis during injury repair was not necessarily a passive consequence of the cellular response to injury.

BackgroundPeriodontal cells such as PDLCs, OBs and GFs have the potential to enhance bone and periodontal regeneration, but face significant challenges, such as the regulatory and cost implications of in vitro cell culture and storage. To address these challenges, it is important to explore alternative 'cell-free' strategies, such as extracellular vesicles which have emerged as promising tools in regenerative medicine, to facilitate osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration. Methods and MaterialsSerial centrifuges at 2600 and 16 000 g were used to isolate apoptotic bodies and microvesicles respectively. Small EV-sEV was enriched by our in-house size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The cellular uptake, proliferation, migration and osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation genes were analysed after EVs uptake in BFP-MSCs. ResultsThree EV subtypes were enriched and characterised by morphology, particle size and EV-associated protein expression-CD9. Cellular uptake of the three EVs subtypes was observed in BFP-MSCs for up to 7 days. sEV from the three periodontal cells promoted proliferation, migration and osteogenic gene expression. hOBs-sEV showed superior levels of osteogenesis markers compared to that hPDLCs-sEV and hGFs-sEV, while hOBs-16k EV promoted adipogenic gene expression compared to that from hPDLCs and hGFs.

Treatment of bone sections with the TUMEL method shows the presence of apoptotic bodies in the terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth cartilage and in osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. On the basis of these findings apoptosis may be considered, as suggested, the programmed final destiny of hypertrophic chondrocytes, and the otherwise unknown terminal fate of the osteoclasts; consequently, it may be involved in bone growth and remodeling. However the frequency of the process is very low in cartilage and bone cells, although it can be increased in osteoclasts by treatment with a number of substances (bisphosphonates, vitamin K-2, TGF-beta, cyclosporine A, tamoxifen, corticosterone, dexamethasone, or specific H+-ATPase inhibitors such as bafilomycin and concanamycin A). This low frequency calls for further investigations before a definitive conclusion can be reached on the role of apoptosis in bone growth and remodeling. On the other hand, it must be considered that the rarity of the process may be deceptive: because of the very short duration of apoptosis, or the possible lack of endonuclease activation, the TUNEL method can in fact underestimate the frequency of positive cells.","1998-03","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:04","1-4","","1","12","","Ital.

Cell recruitment and clearance are the mechanisms by which osteoclast populations are regulated. Research in other tissues has revealed that many cells die after their functional lives are past by a process called apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of apoptosis in osteoclast clearance at orthodontically treated sites as a function of time and location. Orthodontic appliances were placed on 96 rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain. The rats were assigned to either treatment or sham (control) groups and killed 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after appliance placement. Tissue samples were prepared for histochemical evaluation and quantification of morphologic features. Tartrate-resistant acid phophatase (TRAP) and ApopTag (TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick 3' end labeling) stains were used to identify osteoclasts and committed preosteoclasts and to discriminate between apoptotic and nonapoptotic nuclei. Pyknotic nuclei and apoptotic bodies were also counted as a morphologic assessment of apoptosis. The percentages of TRAP/ApopTag-positive nuclei were measured in 4 different periodontal regions. There was a highly significant difference in the overall percentage of TRAP/ApopTag-positive nuclei between the control and the treatment groups at 3, 5, and 7 days (P <.001). Morphologic criteria were also statistically different at days 5 and 7 (P <.05). These data strongly suggested that osteoclasts recruited for orthodontic tooth movement are, at least in part, cleared by apoptosis.","2001-11","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:04","466-476","","5","120","","Am.

Twenty-four beagle canine teeth were used as experimental models. The control group received no treatment, while in the experimental groups, the canines were moved distally with 150 g of orthodontic force for 7 days, 14 days and 28 days. Bone remodeling was detected by H & E staining, while autophagy and apoptosis in the alveolar bone were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. 3-MA and Z-VAD-FMK were used to modulate autophagy and apoptosis. Transmission electron microscopy and western blotting were used to analyze autophagy and apoptosis in BMSCs, while their osteogenesis was analyzed by ALP staining, alizarin red staining, and osteogenic gene analysis. Compared to the control group, we observed significant distal movement of the canines in each of the experimental groups, the distance moved as the loading time was extended. In the experimental groups, the al-veolar bone on the pressure side was clearly absorbed. On the pressure side, teeth were positive for LC3 after loading for 7 days and 14 days, whereas teeth were positive for caspase-3 after loading for 14 days and 28 days. The number of autopha-gosomes and the conversion of LC3-II/LC3-I gradually decreased, nevertheless, the number of apoptotic bodies and the ex-pression of caspase-3 increased gradually. ALP activity, mineralized nodule formation, and osteogenic gene expression in BMSCs gradually decreased. Finally, the down-regulation of autophagy inhibited osteogenesis in BMSCs, whereas the re-striction of apoptosis led to adverse consequences. Collectively, these data indicate that autophagy of the alveolar bone and BMSCs under orthodontic pressure gradually decreased as the loading time was extended, in contrast, the extent of apopto-sis gradually increased; the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was positively correlated with autophagy but negatively correlated with apoptosis.","2022","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:05","147-154","","3","31","","J.

Methods The BM-MSCs were isolated from rats and incubated with osteoblast induction medium, exosomes derived from immature DCs (imDC-Exo), mDC-Exo, and miR-335-deficient mDC-Exo. BM-MSCs treated without or with mDC-Exo were embedded in a bio-compatible matrix (Orthoss(R)) and then implanted into the femoral bone defect of athymic rats. Results mDC-Exo promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs by transferring miR-335. Mechanistically, exosomal miR-335 inhibited Hippo signaling by targeting large tongue suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) and thus promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs. Animal experiments showed that mDC-Exo enhanced BM-MSCs-mediated bone regeneration after bone defect, and this effect was abrogated when miR-335 expression was inhibited in mDC-Exo. Conclusion mDC-Exo promoted osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs and enhanced BM-MSCs-mediated bone regeneration after femoral bone defect in athymic rats by transferring miR-335.","2021-02-26","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:05","20","","1","27","","Mol.

Cell culture results demonstrated that exosomes improved the proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs. Following establishment of a supracondylar femoral bone defect, exosomes and pTa were implanted into the defect area. Results demonstrated that pTa acts as a core scaffold for cell adhesion and exhibits good biocompatibility. Moreover, micro-CT scan results as well as histological examination demonstrated that pTa had a significant effect on osteogenesis, with the addition of exosomes further promoting bone tissue regeneration and repair.

Here, we aimed to pinpoint the role of CGRP in the osteogenic differentiation property of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) and the resultant repair of alveolar bone defect. The key factor related to the osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs was retrieved from the GEO database. After extraction from hADSCs (hADSC-EVs) and identification, EVs were subjected to coculture with hPDLSCs, in which the expression patterns of CGRP and osteogenic differentiation marker proteins (ALP, RUNX2, and OCN), as well as ALP activity, were detected. A novel cell-free tissue-engineered bone (TEB) comprised of PLGA/pDA and hADSC-EVs was implanted into the rats with alveolar bone defects to evaluate the repair of alveolar bone defects. CGRP was enriched in hADSC-EVs. hADSCs delivered CGRP to hPDLSCs through EVs, thereby promoting the osteogenic differentiation potential of hPDLSCs. The PLGA/pDA-EV scaffold released EVs slowly, and its implantation into the rat alveolar bone defect area significantly induced bone defect repair, which was reversed by further knockdown of CGRP. In conclusion, our newly discovered cell-free system consisted of hADSC-EVs, and PLGA/pDA scaffold shows promising function in repairing alveolar bone defects.","2022-06-11","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:05","4815284","","","2022","","Oxidative Med.

Although MtVs have a classically-defined function as an initiator of ossification and recent findings suggest a role for MtVs in the regulation of bone cell biology, the effects of MtVs on bone repair remain unclear. In the present study, we employed collagenase-released EVs (CREVs) containing abundant MtVs from mouse osteoblasts. CREVs were administered locally in gelatin hydrogels to damaged sites after a femoral bone defect in mice. CREVs exhibited the characteristics of MtVs with a diameter <200 nm. The local administration of CREVs significantly promoted the formation of new bone with increases in the number of alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-positive cells and cartilage formation at the damaged site after the femoral bone defect. However, the addition of CREVs to the medium did not promote the osteogenic differentiation of ST2 cells or the ALP activity or mineralization of mouse osteoblasts in vitro. In conclusion, we herein showed for the first time that MtVs enhanced bone repair after a femoral bone defect partly through osteogenesis and chondrogenesis in mice. Therefore, MtVs have potential as a tool for bone regeneration.","2023-04-07","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:05","e0284258","","4","18","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 17 Place: San Francisco Publisher: Public Library Science Web of Science ID: WOS:000988332600001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\54ZBBKFL\Mizukami et al. - 2023 - Matrix vesicles promote bone repair after a femora.pdf","","","COMMUNICATION; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; OSTEOBLASTS; REGENERATION; SKELETAL; STEM-CELLS; STRATEGIES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) have tissue repair capacity and anti-inflammatory properties. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), which are MSCs isolated from pulp tissue, are less invasive to the body than other MSCs and can be collected from young individuals. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of EVs secreted by DPSCs (DPSC-EVs) for bone formation. Methods DPSC-EVs were isolated from the cell culture medium of DPSCs. DPSC-EVs were unilaterally injected along with collagen (COL), beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) or hydroxyapatite (HA) into rat calvarial bone defects. The effects of DPSC-EVs were analyzed by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histological observation. Results Micro-CT showed that administration of DPSC-EVs with the abovementioned scaffolds resulted in bone formation in the periphery of the defects. DPSC-EVs/COL specifically resulted in bone formation in the center of the defects. Histological observation revealed that DPSC-EVs/COL promoted new bone formation. Administration of DPSC-EVs/COL had almost the same effect on the bone defect site as transplantation of DPSCs/COL. Conclusions These results suggest that DPSC-EVs may be effective tools for bone tissue regeneration.","2021-04-14","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:05","12","","1","41","","Inflamm.

Three-dimensional-printed scaffolds can adapt precisely to the complicated shape of the bone defects, which is an alternative solution to bone tissue engineering. Our previous study constructed an innovative low-temperature 3D-printed silk fibroin/collagen I/nano-hydroxyapatite (SF/COL-I/nHA) composite scaffold with a stable structure and remarkable biocompatibility. However, the clinical translation of most scaffolds is limited by insufficient angiogenesis and osteogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effects of human umbilical cord mesenchymal-stem-cell-derived exosomes (hUCMSC-Exos) on bone regeneration, especially from the perspective of inducing angiogenesis. HUCMSC-Exos were isolated and characterized. In vitro, the effect of hUCMSC-Exos on the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was examined. Moreover, the loading and release of hUCMSC-Exos on 3D-printed SF/COL-I/nHA scaffolds were evaluated. In vivo, hUCMSC-Exos and 3D-printed SF/COL-I/nHA scaffolds were implanted into alveolar bone defects, and bone regeneration and angiogenesis were investigated by micro-CT, HE staining, Masson staining, and immunohistochemical analysis. The results showed that hUCMSC-Exos stimulated HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro, and the effect increased with increasing exosome concentrations. In vivo, the combination of hUCMSC-Exos and 3D-printed SF/COL-I/nHA scaffolds promoted alveolar bone defect repair by enhancing angiogenesis and osteogenesis.

The transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) promotes bone repair and regeneration. However, it has been shown that most BMSCs die within a short period after transplantation. During apoptosis, BMSCs generate a large number of apoptotic cell-derived extracellular vesicles (ApoEVs). This study aims to understand the potential role of ApoEVs in craniofacial bone defect repair and regeneration. First, we confirmed that BMSCs undergo apoptosis within 2 d after transplantation into the defect of the cranium. Abundant ApoEVs were generated from apoptotic BMSCs. Uptake of ApoEVs efficiently promoted the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of recipient BMSCs in vitro. ApoEVs from cells in the middle stage of apoptosis were the most efficient to enhance the regenerative capacity of BMSCs. Moreover, a critical size bone defect model in rats was used to evaluate the osteogenic property of ApoEVs in vivo. Local transplantation of ApoEVs promoted bone regeneration in the calvarial defect. Mechanistically, ApoEVs promoted new bone formation by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species to activate JNK signaling. This study reveals a previously unknown role of the dying transplanted BMSCs in promoting the viability of endogenous BMSCs and repairing the calvarial defects. Since it could avoid several adverse effects and limits of BMSC cytotherapy, treatment of ApoEVs might be a promising strategy in craniofacial bone repair and regeneration.","2022-06","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:06","714-723","","6","101","","J.

Hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) plays an important role in bone defect repair, it has the dual function of promoting osteogenesis and vascular regeneration, but it is quickly degraded by the body under normoxic conditions. Previously we prepared mutant HIF-1 alpha, which has been shown to efficiently maintain cellular expression under normoxic conditions. In this study, we evaluated for the first time the role of exosomes of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell carry mutant HIF-1 alpha (BMSC-Exos-HIF1 alpha) in repairing critical-sized bone defects. Evaluation of the effects of BMSC-Exos-HIF1 alpha on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) proliferation and osteogenic differentiation by cell proliferation assay, alkaline phosphatase activity assay, alizarin red staining, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. BMSC-Exos-HIF1 alpha was loaded onto the beta-TCP stent implanted in the bone defect area using a rat cranial critical-sized bone defect model, and new bone formation and neovascularization were detected in vivo by micro-CT, fluorescence labeling analysis, Microfil perfusion, histology and immunohistochemical analysis. In vitro results showed that BMSC-Exos-HIF1 alpha stimulated the proliferation of BMSCs and up-regulated the expression level of bone-related genes, which was superior to bone marrow MSC exosomes (BMSC-Exos). In vivo results showed that BMSC-Exos-HIF1 alpha combined with beta-TCP scaffold promoted new bone regeneration and neovascularization in the bone defect area, and the effect was better than that of BMSC-Exos combined with beta-TCP scaffold. In this study, the results showed that BMSC-Exos-HIF1 alpha stimulated the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and that BMSC-Exos-HIF1 alpha combined with beta-TCP scaffolds could repair critical-sized bone defects by promoting new bone regeneration and neovascularization.","2020-11-19","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:06","565561","","","8","","Front.

The process of bone defect regeneration can be impaired by underlying diseases including DM, but the mechanism remains unclear. In bone tissue engineering, the integration of bionic coatings and bioactive components into basic scaffolds are common function-enhancing strategies. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have been applied for cell-free tissue regeneration in the last few years. We previously reported that sEVs have flexible and easily-extensible potential, through modular design and engineering modification. The impairment of CD31(hi)en-domucinhi endothelial cells (ECs) whose function is coupling of osteogenesis and angiogenesis, is considered an important contributor to diabetic bone osteopathy, and ZEB1, which is highly expressed in CD31(hi)endomucinhi ECs, promotes angiogenesis-dependent bone formation. Thus we believe these ECs hold much promise for use in bone regeneration. In addition, c(RGDfC) has been reported to be a highly-effective peptide targeting alpha v beta 3, which is highly expressed in the bone microenvironment. In this study, we developed a hyaluronic acid (HA)/poly-L-lysine (PLL) layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly coating on beta-TCP (beta-tricalcium phosphate) scaffolds providing immobilization of modularized engineered sEVs (with c(RGDfC) surface functionalization and ZEB1 loading) to facilitate bone defect regeneration under DM conditions. RNA-seq was used to explore possible molecular mechanisms, and the therapeutic effects of bone regeneration were systematically evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Our data demonstrated that this strategy could be very effective in promoting the repair of diabetic bone defects, by enhancing angiogenesis, promoting osteogenesis and inhibiting osteoclast formation.","2022-04","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:06","121465","","","283","","Biomaterials","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 16 Place: Oxford Publisher: Elsevier Sci Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000788725200003","","","","","ACTIVATION; ANGIOGENESIS; Diabetic bone defect; EXOSOMES; Extracellular vesicles; FEMORAL-HEAD; Immobilization; IN-VITRO; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; Optogenetics; OSTEONECROSIS; OSTEOPOROSIS; REGENERATION; Surface functionalization; TYPE-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, new treatments are needed to develop regeneration procedures without side effects. Exosomes secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs, hiPSC-MSC-Exos) incorporate the advantages of both MSCs and iPSCs with no immunogenicity. However, there are no reports on the application of hiPSC-MSC-Exos to enhance angiogenesis and osteogenesis under osteoporotic conditions. HiPSC-MSC-Exos were isolated and identified before use. The effect of hiPSC-MSC-Exos on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow MSCs derived from ovariectomized (OVX) rats (rBMSCs-OVX) in vitro were investigated. In vivo, hiPSC-MSC-Exos were implanted into critical size bone defects in ovariectomized rats, and bone regeneration and angiogenesis were examined by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT), sequential fluorescent labeling analysis, microfil perfusion and histological and immunohistochemical analysis. The results in vitro showed that hiPSC-MSC-Exos enhanced cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and up-regulated mRNA and protein expression of osteoblast-related genes in rBMSCs-OVX. In vivo experiments revealed that hiPSC-MSC-Exos dramatically stimulated bone regeneration and angiogenesis in critical-sized calvarial defects in ovariectomized rats. The effect of hiPSC-MSC-Exos increased with increasing concentration. In this study, we showed that hiPSC-MSC-Exos effectively stimulate the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs-OVX, with the effect increasing with increasing exosome concentration.

Characterize it through field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and FTIR. Then, conduct performance tests such as rheology, dynamic mechanical analysis, in vitro mineralization, and degradation. Rat BMSCs were selected for in vitro cell experiments, and EVs derived from BMSCs were obtained by differential centrifugation. The EVs were loaded onto Gel-OCS/MBGN to obtain Gel-OCS/MBGN@EVs hydrogel. Cell viability and proliferation were detected by live/dead cell staining and CCK-8 assay, respectively. ALP and ARS staining was used to evaluate the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Differential gene expression analysis of osteogenic differentiation was performed using high-throughput sequencing. TargetScan database predicted the binding site between miR-19b-3p and WWP1, and a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the targeting binding site. A rat bone defect model was established, and new bone formation was evaluated by Micro-CT, H&E staining, and Masson's trichrome staining. Immunofluorescence staining and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression levels of osteogenic-related factors in rat BMSCs. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to detect the expression levels of genes and proteins in tissues and cells.ResultGel-OCS/MBGN was successfully constructed and loaded with EVs, resulting in Gel-OCS/MBGN@EVs. The in vitro drug release experiment results show that Gel-OCS/MBGN could sustainably release EVs. Further experiments have shown that Gel-OCS/MBGN@EVs could significantly promote the differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts. Experiments have shown that WWP1 is a key factor in osteogenic differentiation and is regulated by miR-19b-3p. EVs promote osteogenic differentiation by suppressing WWP1 expression through the transmission of miR-19b-3p. In vivo animal experiments have demonstrated that Gel-OCS/MBGN@EVs significantly promote bone repair in rats with bone defects by regulating the miR-19b-3p/WWP1 signaling axis.ConclusionFunctional Gel-OCS/MBGN@EVs were obtained by constructing Gel-OCS/MBGN and loading EVs onto it.

Herein, we addressed this issue in a temperature-responsive PF127 hydrogel loaded with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-derived exosomes (Exos) (PF127 hydrogel@BMSC-Exos) during alveolar bone regeneration. Genes enriched in BMSC-Exos and upregulated during the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and their downstream regulators were predicted by bioinformatics analyses. CTNNB1 was predicted to be the key gene of BMSC-Exos in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, during which miR-146a-5p, IRAK1, and TRAF6 might be the downstream factors. Osteogenic differentiation was induced in BMSCs, in which ectopic expression of CTNNB1 was introduced and from which Exos were isolated. The CTNNB1-enriched PF127 hydrogel@BMSC-Exos were constructed and implanted into in vivo rat models of alveolar bone defects. In vitro experiment data showed that PF127 hydrogel@BMSC-Exos efficiently delivered CTNNB1 to BMSCs, which subsequently promoted the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, as evidenced by enhanced ALP staining intensity and activity, extracellular matrix mineralization (p < 0.05), and upregulated RUNX2 and OCN expression (p < 0.05). Functional experiments were conducted to examine the relationships among CTNNB1, microRNA (miR)-146a-5p, and IRAK1 and TRAF6. Mechanistically, CTNNB1 activated miR-146a-5p transcription to downregulate IRAK1 and TRAF6 (p < 0.05), which induced the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and facilitated alveolar bone regeneration in rats (increased new bone formation and elevated BV/TV ratio and BMD, all with p < 0.05). Collectively, CTNNB1-containing PF127 hydrogel@BMSC-Exos promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by regulating the miR-146a-5p/IRAK1/TRAF6 axis, thus inducing the repair of alveolar bone defects in rats.","2023-03","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:06","1083","","6","13","","Nanomaterials","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 19 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000959604600001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\K5XAC4X3\He et al. - 2023 - PF127 Hydrogel-Based Delivery of Exosomal CTNNB1 f.pdf","","","alveolar bone defect; bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells; CTNNB1; exosomes; INJURY; INTERVERTEBRAL DISC DEGENERATION; IRAK1; MARROW; microRNA-146a-5p; MIR-146A-5P; MODEL; osteogenic differentiation; PROTECT; temperature-responsive hydrogel; TRAF6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exosomes from different human cells have shown macrophage immunomodulation-mediated bone regeneration potential. However, the effect of human serum-derived exosomes (serum-Exo) on macrophage immunomodulation-mediated angiogenesis during bone defect repair has not been investigated yet. In this study, we explored the effects of serum-Exo on macrophage inflammation regulation-mediated angiogenesis during bone defect repair and preliminarily elucidated the mechanism. Healthy serum-Exo was isolated by ultracentrifugation. The effect of serum-Exo on LPS-induced M1 macrophage inflammation was analysed in vitro. The conditioned medium of serum-Exo-treated LPS-induced M1 macrophage (serum-Exo-treated M1 macrophage-CM) was used to culture human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and the effect on angiogenesis was analysed by western blot, qRT-PCR, etc. mRNA-sequencing of HUVECs was performed to identify deferentially expressed genes. Finally, the rat mandibular defect model was established and treated with Bio-Oss and Bio-Oss + Exo. The effect of the Bio-Oss + Exo combination on mandibular bone regeneration was observed by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, Masson staining, and immunohistochemical staining. Serum-Exo promoted the proliferation of RAW264.7 macrophages and reduced the expression of M1-related genes such as IL-6, IL-1 beta, iNOS, and CD86. Serum-Exo-treated M1 macrophage-CM induced the proliferation, migration, and angiogenic differentiation of HUVEC, as well as the expression of H-type blood vessel markers CD31 and endomucin (EMCN), compared with M1 macrophage-CM. Moreover, higher expression of vascular endothelial adhesion factor 1 (VCAM1) in HUVEC cultured with serum-Exo-treated M1 macrophage-CM compared with M1 macrophages-CM. Inhibition of VCAM1 signalling abrogated the pro-angiogenic effect of serum-Exo-treated M1 macrophage-CM on HUVEC. Local administration of serum-Exo during mandibular bone defect repair reduced the number of M1 macrophages and promoted angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Collectively, our results demonstrate the macrophage inflammation regulation-mediated pro-angiogenic potential of serum-Exo during bone defect repair possibly via upregulation of VCAM1 signalling in HUVEC.","2023-04","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:07","1131-1143","","8","27","","J.

Thus, promoting angiogenesis during the bone repair process is vital for ideal bone regeneration. As important mediators of cell-cell communication and biological homeostasis, mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEVs) have been proved to be highly involved in bone and vascular regeneration. Because hypoxia microenvironment promotes the proangiogenic activity of MSCs, in the present study, we investigate the effect and underlying molecular mechanisms of sEVs from hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs (hypo-sEVs) on angiogenesis and develop an effective strategy to promote vascularized bone regeneration. Compared to sEVs from normoxia MSCs (nor-sEVs), hypo-sEVs promoted the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of HUVECs and ultimately enhanced bone regeneration and new blood vessel reconstruction in a critical-size calvarial bone defect model. miRNA sequence and the verified results showed that miR-210-3p in hypo-sEVs was increased via HIF-1 alpha under hypoxia. The upregulated miR-210-3p in hypo-sEVs promoted angiogenesis by downregulating EFNA3 expression and enhancing the phosphorylation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, this study suggests a successful strategy to enhance vascularized bone regeneration by utilizing hypo-sEVs via the miR-210-3p/EFNA3/PI3K/AKT pathway. Statement of significance Considering the significance of vascularization in ideal bone regeneration, strategies to promote angiogenesis during bone repair are required. Hypoxia microenvironment can promote the proangiogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Nonetheless, the therapeutic effect of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs on cranio-maxillofacial bone defect remains unknown, and the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. This study shows that hypo-sEVs significantly enhance the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of HUVECs as well as promote vascularized bone formation. Moreover, this work indicates that HIF-1 alpha can induce overexpression of miR-210-3p under hypoxia, and miR-210-3p can hinder EFNA3 expression and subsequently activate the PI3K/AKT pathway. The application of hypo-sEVs provides a facile and promising strategy to promote vascularized bone regeneration in a critical-size bone defect model. (c) 2022 The Authors.

The newly formed microvessels inside grafts play a crucial role in successful bone tissue engineering. Previously, an active role for mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes in blood vessel development and progression was suggested in the repair of multiple tissues. However, the reports on the application of MSC-derived exosomes in the repair of large bone defects are sparse. In this study, we encapsulated umbilical MSC-derived exosomes ((EXOs)-E-uMSC) in hyaluronic acid hydrogel (HA-Gel) and combined them with customized nanohydroxyapatite/poly-epsilon-caprolactone (nHP) scaffolds to repair cranial defects in rats. Imaging and histological evaluation indicated that the (EXOs)-E-uMSC/Gel/nHP composites markedly enhanced bone regeneration in vivo, and the (EXOs)-E-uMSC might play a key role in this process. Moreover, the in vitro results demonstrated that (EXOs)-E-uMSC promoted the proliferation, migration, and angiogenic differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) but did not significantly affect the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Importantly, mechanistic studies revealed that exosomal miR-21 was the potential intercellular messenger that promoted angiogenesis by upregulating the NOTCH1/DLL4 pathway. In conclusion, our findings exhibit a promising exosome-based strategy in repairing large bone defects through enhanced angiogenesis, which potentially regulated by the miR-21/NOTCH1/DLL4 signaling axis.","2021-04-28","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:07","18472-18487","","16","13","","ACS Appl.

Exosomes modified tissue engineering scaffolds are one of the promising cell-free approach for repairing the defects. Despite extensive knowledge of the variety kinds of exosomes promote tissue regeneration, little is known of the effect and mechanism for the adipose stem cells-derived exosomes (ADSCs-Exos) on bone defect repair. This study aimed to explore whether ADSCs-Exos and ADSCs-Exos modified tissue engineering scaffold promotes bone defects repair.Material/Methods: ADSCs-Exos were isolated and identified by transmission electron microscopy nanoparticle tracking analysis, and western blot.

The CCK-8 assay, scratch wound assay, alkaline phosphatase activity assay, and alizarin red staining were used to evaluate the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Subsequently, a bio-scaffold, ADSCs-Exos modified gelatin sponge/polydopamine scaffold (GS-PDA-Exos), were prepared. After characterized by scanning electron microscopy and exosomes release assay, the repair effect of the GS-PDA-Exos scaffold on BMSCs and bone defects was evaluated in vitro and in vivo.Results: The diameter of ADSCs-exos is around 122.1 nm and high expressed exosome-specific markers CD9 and CD63. ADSCs-Exos promote the proliferation migration and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. ADSCs-Exos was combined with gelatin sponge by polydopamine (PDA)coating and released slowly. After exposed to the GS-PDA-Exos scaffold, BMSCs have more calcium nodules with osteoinductive medium and higher expression the mRNA of osteogenic related genes compared with other groups. The quantitative analysis of all micro-CT parameters showed that GS-PDA-Exos scaffold promote new bone formed in the femur defect model in vivo and confirmed by histological analysis.Conclusion: This study demonstrates the repair efficacy of ADSCs-Exos in bone defects, ADSCs-Exos modified scaffold showing a huge potential in the treatment of large bone defects.","2023-02-09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:07","1096390","","","11","","Front.

In this study, by integrating silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) and M2 macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (M2EVs), a multifunctional DNA-based hydrogel, called Agevgel, is developed with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and osteogenic properties to promote DABD rebuilding. AgNCs are tightly embedded into the DNA scaffolds and exhibit effective anti-bacterial activity, while immunomodulatory M2EVs are encapsulated within the shape-variable DNA scaffolds and exhibit potent anti-inflammatory and osteogenic properties. The results reveal that Agevgel effectively prolongs the local retention time and bioactivity of M2EVs in vivo. In particular, the sustained release of M2EVs can last for at least 7 days when applying Agevgel to DABD. Compared to free M2EVs or Aggel (AgNCs encapsulated within the DNA hydrogel) treatments, the Agevgel treatment accelerates the defect healing rate of alveolar bone and dramatically improves the trabecular architecture. Mechanistically, Agevgel plays a key role in regulating macrophage polarization and promoting the expression of proliferative and osteogenic factors. In summary, Agevgel provides a comprehensive treatment strategy for DABD with a great clinical translational value, highlighting the application of DNA hydrogels as an ideal bioscaffolds for periodontal diseases. The multiple effects of Agevgel on diabetic alveolar bone defect (DABD) are investigated. Dressing the DABD with Agevgel results in sustained release of silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) and M2 macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (M2EVs). It can synergistically ameliorate inflammation, enhance proliferation, induce osteogenesis, and prevent bacterial infection, representing significant potential for promoting DABD reconstruction.image","2023-11-02","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:07","","","","","","Small","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 12 Place: Weinheim Publisher: Wiley-V C H Verlag Gmbh Web of Science ID: WOS:001091927500001","","","","","anti-bacterial; diabetic periodontal diseases; DNA hydrogel; extracellular vesicles delivery; FRACTURE; inflammation; MELLITUS; PERIODONTITIS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Systemic ad-ministration of exosomes represents as a minimally invasive delivery approach; however, evaluation for the lesion-targeting capacity and repair promotion efficacy lacks. In this study, exosomes produced by human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) are intravenously injected to calvarial defect mice. It is found that exosomes preferentially accumulate at bone and especially at the calvarial defect site. In addition, exosomes treatment promotes osteogenesis as indicated by more newly formed bone at the lesion site. Furthermore, the impact of three-dimensional (3D) culture on hADSCs is evaluated by transcriptome sequencing and several pathways such as bone development, cartilage development are up-regulated in 3D-cultured hADSCs, suggesting an improved tissue repair capacity. Moreover, exosomes from 3D-cultured hADSCs show distinctly superior bone-targeting effects and bone repair capacity, as compared to those derived from 2D-cultured hADSCs. Collectively, this study highlights the bone-targeting and pro-osteogenic effects of hADSCs-derived exosomes, which could be further enhanced by 3D culture of the parental cells.

Timely transformation of microenvironment from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory after acute immune response is favorable for osteogenesis. Macrophages play an important role in the immune response to inflammation. Therefore, this study adopts TIM3 high expression extracellular vesicles (EVs) with immunosuppressive function to reshape the early immune microenvironment of bone injury, mainly by targeting macrophages. These EVs can be phagocytosed by macrophages, thereby increasing the infiltration of TIM3-positive macrophages (TIM3+ macrophages) and M2 subtypes. The TIM3+ macrophage group has some characteristics of M2 macrophages and secretes cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-beta 1 to regulate inflammation. TIM3, which is highly expressed in the engineered EVs, mediates the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the p38/MAPK pathway and promotes osseointegration by activating the Bmp2 promoter to enhance macrophage BMP2 secretion. After evenly loading the engineered EVs into the hydrogel, the continuous and slow release of EVsTIM3OE recruits more anti-inflammatory macrophages during the early stages of bone defect repair, regulating the immune microenvironment and eliminating the adverse effects of excessive inflammation. In summary, this study provides a new strategy for the treatment of refractory wounds through early inflammation control. Timely transformation of microenvironment from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory after acute immune response is favorable for osteogenesis. TIM3 high expression EVs are packaged within hydrogel.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs)-based cell-free regenerative therapies represent a promising alternative for traditional treatments. Developmental biology suggests matrix vesicles (MVs), a subtype of EVs, contain mineralizing-related biomolecules and play an important role in osteogenesis. Thus, we explore the therapeutic benefits and expect to find an optimized strategy for MV application. Methods Healthy human dental follicle cells (DFCs) were cultured with the osteogenic medium to generate MVs. Media MVs (MMVs) were isolated from culture supernatant, and collagenase-released MVs (CRMVs) were acquired from collagenase-digested cell suspension. We compared the biological features of the two MVs and investigated their induction of cell proliferation, migration, mineralization, and the modulation of osteogenic genes expression. Furthermore, we investigated the long-term regenerative capacity of MMVs and CRMVs in an alveolar bone defect rat model. Results We found that both DFC-derived MMVs and CRMVs effectively improved the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of DFCs. Notably, CRMVs showed better bone regeneration capabilities. Compared to MMVs, CRMVs-induced DFCs exhibited increased synthesis of osteogenic marker proteins including ALP, OCN, OPN, and MMP-2. In the treatment of murine alveolar bone defects, CRMV-loaded collagen scaffold brought more significant therapeutic outcomes with less unhealing areas and more mature bone tissues in comparison with MMVs and acquired the effects resembling DFCs-based treatment. Furthermore, the western blotting results demonstrated the activation of the PLC/PKC/MAPK pathway in CRMVs-induced DFCs, while this cascade was inhibited by MMVs. Conclusions In summary, our findings revealed a novel cell-free regenerative therapy for repairing alveolar bone defects by specific MV subtypes and suggest that PLC/PKC/MAPK pathways contribute to MVs-mediated alveolar bone regeneration.","2022-01-29","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:08","41","","1","13","","Stem Cell Res.

In this study, human periodontal ligament stem cell (PDLSC)-derived sEVs (P-EVs) were immobilized in Matrigel to establish a topical cell-free transplantation strategy for bone repair. Methods: PDLSCs were cultured and P-EVs were isolated from the culture supernatant. In a rat bilateral calvarial defect model, P-EV/Matrigel was plugged into one defect and PBS/Matrigel was applied to the other. Bone repair in vivo was assessed by micro computed tomography, histomorphometry, and immunohistochemical staining. In vitro, we investigated the effects of P-EVs on the proliferation and migration capabilities of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) and explored the potential mechanism of action. Results: The in vivo study showed that P-EV/Matrigel accelerated bone tissue repair by increasing cell infiltration when compared with the control. In vitro, P-EVs enhanced proliferation and migration of BMMSCs via increased phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). The role of P-EV-induced adenosine receptor signaling in AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was a key mediator during enhanced BMMSC migration. Conclusion: These results are the first to demonstrate that P-EVs accelerated the repair of bone defects, partially through promoting cell proliferation and migration.

Exosomal miRNAs of BMSCs have been reported to participate in osteoblastogenesis and modulating bone formation. However, their impacts on the development of bone degeneration in DM are not yet known. The role of miRNAs in BMSCs exosomes on regulating hyperglycemia bone degeneration was investigated in the present study. Results: The osteogenic potential in bone defect repair of exosomes derived from diabetes mellitus BMSCs derived exosomes (DM-Exos) were revealed to be lower than that in normal BMSCs derived exosomes (N-Exos) in vitro and in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that miR-140-3p level was significantly altered in exosomes derived from BMSCs, ADSCs and serum from DM rats. In in vitro experiments, upregulated miR-140-3p exosomes promoted DM BMSCs differentiation into osteoblasts. The effects were exerted by miR-140-3p targeting plxnb1, plexin B1 is the receptor of semaphoring 4D(Sema4D) that inhibited osteocytes differentiation, thereby promoting bone formation. In DM rats with bone defect, miR-140-3p upregulated exosomes were transplanted into injured bone and accelerated bone regeneration. Besides, miR-140-3p in the exosomes was transferred into BMSCs and osteoblasts and promoted bone regeneration by targeting the plexin B1/RohA/ROCK signaling pathway. Conclusions: Normal-Exos and miR-140-3p overexpressed-Exos accelerated diabetic wound healing by promoting the osteoblastogenesis function of BMSCs through inhibition plexin B1 expression which is the receptor of Sema4D and the plexin B1/RhoA/ROCK pathway compared with diabetes mellitus-Exos. This offers a new insight and a new therapy for treating diabetic bone unhealing.","2022-03-02","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:08","97","","1","20","","J.

However, the reconstruction of blood vessels and neural networks is often neglected in material design. This study aims to design a genetically functionalized matrix (GFM) and enable it to regulate angiogenesis and neurogenesis to accelerate the process of bone defect repair. The dual small interfering RNA (siRNA)-polyvinylimide (PEI) (siRP) complexes that locally knocked down soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (sFlt-1) and p75 neurotrophic factor receptor (p75NTR) are prepared. The hybrid cell membrane (MM) loaded siRP is synthesized as siRNA@MMs to coat on polylactone (PCL) electrospun fibers for mimicking the natural bone matrix. The results indicates that siRNA@MMs could regulate the expression of vascular-related and neuro-related cytokines secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). GFMs promote the expression of osteogenic differentiation through paracrine function in vitro. GFMs attenuates inflammation and promotes osseointegration by regulating the coupling of vascularization and innervation in vivo. This study uses the natural hybrid cell membrane to carry genetic material and assist in the vascularization and innervation function of two siRNA. The results present the significance of neuro-vascularized organoid bone and may provide a promising choice for the design of bone tissue engineering scaffold. This work here provides a dual siRNA-loaded cell membrane functionalized matrix that facilitates bone regeneration with angiogenesis and neurogenesis. The genetically functionalized matrix (GFM) regulates the expression of vascular and neural related genes, and promotes the vascular and neural paracrine signaling. The GFM with the function of angiogenesis and neurogenesis improves the bone defects microenvironment and achieves bone defect repair.image","2023-10-12","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:08","","","","","","Small","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 15 Place: Weinheim Publisher: Wiley-V C H Verlag Gmbh Web of Science ID: WOS:001079471700001","","","","","bone regeneration; cell membranes; DELIVERY; GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; GROWTH-FACTOR; innervation; KNOCKING; MICROVESICLES; NERVE GROWTH; PLASMA; REPAIR; RNAi delivery; vascularization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and Methods: The hUC-MSC exosomes were purified and characterized. The scaffolds were prepared by a freeze-drying method. Animals were divided into five groups, and the CS/HA/exosome (CS/HA/Exo) scaffolds were transplanted to 5 x 2-mm critical-sized calvarial bone defects for repair in rats. All animals were sacrificed at the postoperative sixth week. Immunohistochemical and histologic analyses were performed. Results: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the exosomes were round-shaped vesicles with bounded membrane, and the diameter of the exosomes was 83.728 +/- 27.269 nm. Histologic analysis showed that mean new bone volumes were statistically significantly higher in the CS/HA/Exo group (1.83 +/- O.54, PCS/Exo-CS/HA/Exo = center dot 000), and other new bone volumes in the other groups were statistically significant compared with the control (CS/Exo 1.50 +/- O.14 mm3; CS 1.2O +/- O.43 mm3; control 1.06 +/- 0.10 mm3; and CS/ HA 1.43 +/- 0.66 mm3).

The exosomes, micro vesicles of 30-150 nm in diameter, derived from macrophages manipulated bone regeneration. However, the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the biogenesis and function of exosomes and its effects on bone regeneration remains elusive. In this study, we used H2S slow releasing donor GYY4137 to stimulate macrophages and found that H2S promoted the polarization of M2 macrophages to increase bone regeneration of MSCs in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we developed the H2S pre-treated M2 macrophage exosomes and found these exosomes displayed significantly higher capacity to promote bone regeneration in calvarial bone defects by reestablishing the local immune microenvironment. Mechanically, H2S treatment altered the protein profile of exosomes derived from M2 macrophages. One of the significantly enriched exosomal proteins stimulated by H2S, moesin protein, facilitated the exosomes endocytosis into MSCs, leading to activated the I3-catenin signaling pathway to promote osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. In summary, H2S pretreated M2 exosomes promoted the bone regeneration of MSCs via facilitating exosomes uptake by MSCs and activate I3-catenin signaling pathway. This study not only provides new strategies for promoting bone regeneration, but also provides new insights for the effect and mechanism of exosomes internalization.","2024-01","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:08","192-205","","","31","","Bioact.

Accelerating both angiogenesis and osteogenesis can promote effective bone healing. In the natural healing process, angiogenesis precedes osteogenesis, providing a blood supply that supports the subsequent progression of osteogenesis. Developing a biomimetic scaffold that mimics the in vivo environment and promotes the proper sequence of vascularization followed by ossification is crucial for successful bone regeneration. In this study, a novel injectable dual-drug programmed releasing chitosan nanofibrous microsphere-based poly(D, L-lactide-co-glycolide)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) hydrogel is fabricated by incorporating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microspheres loaded with dental pulp stem cellsderived exosomes (DPSCs-Exo). Rapid release of VEGF promotes the swift initiation of angiogenesis, while DPSCs-Exo release ensures persistent osteogenesis. Our results demonstrate that chitosan microsphere-based PLGA-PEG-PLGA hydrogel significantly promotes angiogenesis in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and enhances the osteogenic differentiation of pre-osteoblasts. Furthermore, in vivo transplantation of this injectable chitosan microsphere-based PLGA-PEG-PLGA hydrogel into calvarial bone defects markedly promotes bone formation. Overall, our study provides a promising approach for improving bone regeneration by temporally replicating the behavior of angiogenesis and osteogenesis.","2023-12-31","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:08","126721","","","253","","Int.

Conventional strategies primarily combine bone scaffolds with seed cells and growth factors to modulate osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Nevertheless, cell-based therapies have some intrinsic issues regarding immunogenicity, tumorigenesis, bioactivity and off-the-shelf transplantation. Exosomes are nano-sized (50-200 nm) extracellular vesicles with a complex composition of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, which are attractive as therapeutic nanoparticles for disease treatment. Exosomes also have huge potential as desirable drug/gene delivery vectors in the field of regenerative medicine due to their excellent biocompatibility and efficient cellular internalization. Methods: We developed a cell-free tissue engineering system using functional exosomes in place of seed cells. Gene-activated engineered exosomes were constructed by using ATDCS-derived exosomes to encapsulate the VEGF gene. The specific exosomal anchor peptide CP05 acted as a flexible linker and effectively combined the engineered exosome nanoparticles with 3D-printed porous bone scaffolds. Results: Our findings demonstrated that engineered exosomes play dual roles as an osteogenic matrix to induce the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and as a gene vector to controllably release the VEGF gene to remodel the vascular system. In vivo evaluation further verified that the engineered exosome-mediated bone scaffolds could effectively induce the bulk of vascularized bone regeneration. Conclusion: In our current work, we designed specifically engineered exosomes based on the requirements of vascularized bone repair in segmental bone defects.

In fact, several in vitro studies have already demonstrated the efficacy of Extracellular Vesicles (EV) in promoting bone regeneration and repair in various orthopedic models. Therefore, to evaluate the translational potential in this field, an in vivo study was performed. Methods: Here, we used hyaluronic acid (HA) gels formulated with pEVs, as a way to directly apply pEVs and retain them at the bone defect. In this study, pEVs were isolated from Platelet Lysate (PL) through size exclusion chromatography and used to formulate 2% HA gels. Then, the gels were locally applied on the tibia cortical bone defect of New Zeland White rabbits before the surgical implantation of coin-shaped titanium implants. After eight weeks, the bone healing process was analyzed through biomechanical, micro-CT, histological and biochemical analysis.Results: Although no biomechanical differences were observed between pEV formulated gels and non-formulated gels, biochemical markers of the wound fluid at the interface presented a decrease in Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity for pEV HA treated implants. Moreover, histological analyses showed that none of the treatments induced an irritative effect and, a decrease in the fibrotic response surrounding the implant for pEV HA treated implants was described.Conclusion: In conclusion, pEVs improve titanium implants biocompatibility at the bone-implant interface, decreasing the necrotic effects of the surgery and diminishing the fibrotic layer associated to the implant encapsulation that can lead to implant failure.","2023-05","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","2024-01-26 18:22:09","72-79","","","40","","J.

The potential mechanisms were further investigated. Results The effect of exosomes combined with DPSCs was remarkable on bone regeneration in vivo and exosomes promoted osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs in vitro. Mechanistically, exosomes increased the expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) in DPSCs by transferring TFAM mRNA. Moreover, highly expressed TFAM in DPSCs enhanced glutamate metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity. Conclusions Consequently, exosomes strengthened bone regeneration of DPSCs through the activation of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism. Our study provides a new potential strategy to improve DPSC-based bone regenerative treatment.","2022-12","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:40","e13324","","12","55","","Cell Prolif.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 12 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000846477200001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\AP7P5MWE\Guo et al. - 2022 - Exosome-shuttled mitochondrial transcription facto.pdf","","","BIOGENESIS; DIFFERENTIATION; REGENERATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There has been much interest in the use of three-dimensional (3D) engineered scaffolds (PLA) complexed with human gingival mesenchymal stem cells (hGMSCs) as a new therapeutic strategy to improve bone tissue regeneration. These devices can mimic a more favorable endogenous microenvironment for cells in vivo by providing 3D substrates which are able to support cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. The present study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo capability of bone defect regeneration of 3D PLA, hGMSCs, extracellular vesicles (EVs), or polyethyleneimine (PEI)-engineered EVs (PEI-EVs) in the following experimental groups: 3D-PLA, 3D-PLA + hGMSCs, 3D-PLA + EVs, 3D-PLA + EVs + hGMSCs, 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs, 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs. Methods: The structural parameters of the scaffold were evaluated using both scanning electron microscopy and nondestructive microcomputed tomography. Nanotopographic surface features were investigated by means of atomic force microscopy. Scaffolds showed a statistically significant mass loss along the 112-day evaluation. Results: Our in vitro results revealed that both 3D-PLA + EVs + hGMSCs and 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs showed no cytotoxicity. However, 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs exhibited greater osteogenic inductivity as revealed by morphological evaluation and transcriptomic analysis performed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). In addition, in vivo results showed that 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs and 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs scaffolds implanted in rats subjected to cortical calvaria bone tissue damage were able to improve bone healing by showing better osteogenic properties. These results were supported also by computed tomography evaluation that revealed the repair of bone calvaria damage. Conclusion: The re-establishing of the integrity of the bone lesions could be a promising strategy in the treatment of accidental or surgery trauma, especially for cranial bones.","2018-04-13","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:40","104","","","9","","Stem Cell Res.

However, application of exosomes in bone defect repair and regeneration has been rarely reported, and little is known regarding their underlying mechanisms. Methods: Exosomes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hiPS-MSC-Exos) were combined with tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) to repair critical-sized calvarial bone defects, and the efficacy was assessed by histological examination. We evaluated the in vitro effects of hiPSC-MSC-Exos on the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) by cell-counting, scratch assays, and qRT-PCR, respectively. Gene expression profiling and bioinformatics analyses were also used to identify the underlying mechanisms in the repair. Results: We found that the exosome/beta-TCP combination scaffolds could enhance osteogenesis as compared to pure beta-TCP scaffolds. In vitro assays showed that the exosomes could release from beta-TCP and could be internalized by hBMSCs. In addition, the internalization of exosomes into hBMSCs could profoundly enhance the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Furthermore, gene expression profiling and bioinformatics analyses demonstrated that exosome/beta-TCP combination scaffolds significantly altered the expression of a network of genes involved in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Functional studies further confirmed that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was the critical mediator during the exosome-induced osteogenic responses of hBMSCs. Conclusions: We propose that the exosomes can enhance the osteoinductivity of beta-TCP through activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway of hBMSCs, which means that the exosome/beta-TCP combination scaffolds possess better osteogenesis activity than pure beta-TCP scaffolds. These results indicate that naturally secreted nanocarriers-exosomes can be used as a bioactive material to improve the bioactivity of the biomaterials, and that hiPS-MSC-Exos combined with beta-TCP scaffolds can be potentially used for repairing bone defects.","2016-09-20","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:40","136","","","7","","Stem Cell Res.

In general, M2 macrophage facilitate the promotion of osteogenesis, as well, M1 macrophage play an important role in early bone healing, as confirmed by previous studies. However, it is not clear how M1 macrophage are involved in the bone immune response. MiR-21a-5p is a highly expressed microRNA in M1 macrophage in contrast to M2. Therefore, the current work sought to ascertain the influence of M1 macrophage on bone healing via exosomal miR-21a-5p and the probable mechanism. We discovered that injecting M1 macrophage exosomes overexpressing miR-21a-5p into bone defect locations enhanced bone regeneration in vivo. Furthermore, by directly targeting GATA2, miR-21a-5p accelerated MC3T3-E1 osteogenic differentiation. Our findings showed that exosomal miR-21a-5p from M1 macrophage may be transported to osteoblasts and target GATA2 to enhance bone defect healing.

The aim of this study was to compare the therapeutic benefit of EVs obtained from adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSC) on bone repair whereas using ss-tricalcium phosphate (ss-TCP) biomaterial as a carrier. Materials and Method: A single critical size bone defect of 8 mm in diameter was created on the right side of rat calvarium using a custom-made punch needle. Animals were randomly divided into 5 groups: group 1 (no treatment), group 2 (bone graft), group 3 (ss-TCP + ADSC), group 4 (ss-TCP + EV), group 5 (ss-TCP). Eight weeks later, animals were sacrificed and histologic and radiologic evaluation was performed. Results: Semiquantitative histologic scoring demonstrated significantly higher bone regeneration scores for groups 2, 3, and 4 compared to group 1. Radiologic imaging showed significantly higher bone mineral density for groups 2, 3, and 5 compared to group 1. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in either histologic or radiologic scoring. Conclusions: Our data showed that EVs provided from thermally induced ADSCs did not show any significant difference in bone regeneration when compared to ADSCs themselves. Future studies should focus on determining the optimum amount and content of EV application since these vary significantly depending on the microenvironment.","2021-09","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:41","2245-2250","","6","32","","J.

Muscle cell-derived EVs (Myo-EVs) were isolated from the conditioned medium from mouse muscle C2C12 cells by ultracentrifugation, after which Myo-EVs and gelatin hydrogel sheets were transplanted on femoral bone defect sites. The local administration of Myo-EVs significantly improved delayed bone repair that was induced by the diabetic state in mice 9 days after surgery. Moreover, this administration significantly enhanced the ratio of bone volume to tissue volume at the damaged sites 9 days after surgery in the control mice. Moreover, the local administration of Myo-EVs significantly blunted the number of Osterix-positive cells that were suppressed by the diabetic state at the damage sites after bone injury in mice. Additionally, Myo-EVs significantly blunted the mRNA levels of Osterix and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and ALP activity was suppressed by advanced glycation end product 3 in ST2 cells that were treated with bone morphogenetic protein-2. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that the local administration of Myo-EVs improves delayed bone repair that is induced by the diabetic state through an enhancement of osteoblastic differentiation in female mice.","2022-10-05","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:41","","","","","","Endocr.

Recent studies have explored the possibility of functional modification of scaffolds in bone tissue engineering. We prepared an SF-CS-nHA (SCN) biomimetic bone scaffold and functionally modified the scaffold material by adding a polydopamine (PDA) coating loaded with exosomes (Exos) of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The effects of the functional composite scaffold (SCN/PDA-Exo) on BMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were investigated. Furthermore, the SCN/PDA-Exo scaffolds were implanted into animals to evaluate their effect on bone regeneration. Methods: SCN biomimetic scaffolds were prepared by a vacuum freeze-drying/chemical crosslinking method. A PDA-functionalized coating loaded with BMSC-Exos was added by the surface coating method. The physical and chemical properties of the functional composite scaffolds were detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy spectrum analysis and contact angle tests. In vitro, BMSCs were inoculated on different scaffolds, and the Exo internalization by BMSCs was detected by confocal microscopy. The BMSC proliferation activity and cell morphology were detected by SEM, CCK-8 assays and phalloidin staining. BMSC osteogenic differentiation was detected by immunofluorescence, alizarin red staining and qRT-PCR. In vivo, the functional composite scaffold was implanted into a rabbit critical radial defect model. Bone repair was detected by 3D-CT scanning. HE staining, Masson staining, and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate bone regeneration. Results: Compared with the SCN scaffold, the SCN/PDA-Exo-functionalized composite scaffold had a larger average surface roughness and stronger hydrophilicity. In vitro, the Exos immobilized on the SCN/ PDA-Exo scaffolds were internalized by BMSCs. The BMSC morphology, proliferation ability and osteogenic differentiation effect in the SCN/PDA-Exo group were significantly better than those in the other control groups (p < 0.05). The effects of the SCN/PDA-Exo functional composite scaffold on bone defect repair and new bone formation were significantly better than those of the other control groups (p < 0.05).Conclusions: In this study, we found that the SCN/PDA-Exo-functionalized composite scaffold promoted BMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in vitro and improved bone regeneration efficiency in vivo. Therefore, combining Exos with biomimetic bone scaffolds by functional PDA coatings may be an effective strategy for functionally modifying biological scaffolds.

The use of biomimetic scaffolds for bone tissue engineering has been investigated for decades. To date, the trend in this area has been moved toward the construction of biomimetic acellular scaffolds with effective modification to enhance the osteogenic differentiation efficiency of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The exosomes derived from BMSCs have been shown as a potential therapeutic tool for repairing bone defects. In this study, we demonstrated the pro-osteogenic effects of exosomes derived form osteogenic differentiated BMSCs (OBMSC) and presented a novel exosmes-functionalized decellularized fish scale (DE-FS) scaffold for promoting bone regeneration in vivo. The DE-FS scaffolds were obtained through decellularization and decalcification processes, which exhibited high biocompatibility and low immunological rejection. The intrinsic anisotropic structures of DE-FS could enhance the adhesion and proliferation ability of BMSCs in vitro. In addition, we demonstrated that the porous structure of DE-FS endowed them with the capacity to load and release exosomes to BMSCs, resulting in the enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Concerning these pro-osteogenic effects, it was further proved that OBMSC exosome-modified DE-FS scaffolds could effectively promote bone regeneration in the mouse calvarial defect models. In conclusion, our work provided a new insight to design exosome-riched biomimetic scaffolds for bone tissue engineering and clinical applications.","2022-10-12","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:41","444","","1","20","","J.

The characteristics and function of exosomes are affected by the bidirectional communication of their original cells and the local microenvironment in which the cells reside (e.g., the stem cell niche). However, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are customarily cultured in a traditional two-dimensional monolayer, with mechanical microenvironments varying substantially in physiological one. Few reports have addressed the effects of the 3D microenvironment on exosomal osteoinductivity. Herein, a 3D culture model is engineered through collagen hydrogel. Exosomes derived from three-dimensional culture (3D-Exos) and the conventional monolayer culture (2D-Exos) are collected and compared. The 3D culture resulted in high yield exosomes and greatly improved the efficiency of exosomes collection. The in vitro results demonstrated that the 3D-Exos induced significant promotions in osteogenic gene and protein expression (e.g., Runx2, OCN, OPN, COL1A1, and ALP), proliferation, and migration of Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and inhibited hBMSCs apoptosis. Importantly, mechanistic studies revealed that the upregulation of the YAP signaling pathway is the underlying mechanism. Moreover, the 3D-Exos resulted in enhanced new bone formation and Runx2/OPN activation in rats with alveolar bone defects. These findings proposed a novel idea of the 3D culture strategy used to enhance the osteoinductivity of MSC-derived exosomes. This study also provided valuable references for exosome-based clinical applications for the treatment and regeneration of tissue defects from the perspective of culture dimensions.","2022-02","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:41","112646","","","133","","Biomater.

Thus, a ""cocktail"" of bioactive factors supplemented to the defect sites is desirable for bone repair. In this regard, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells hold great potential in tissue repair. Nevertheless, the poor homing and retention of sEVs greatly limited their possible clinical application. In the present work, DMPE-PEGCREKA was inserted into the membrane of sEVs released from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells to obtain CREKA functionalized sEVs (CREKA-sEVs), which could target fibrin to accumulate and retain in bone defects. Our results showed that CREKA-sEVs, like sEVs, promoted the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, the angiogenic property of HUVECs, and modulated the polarization of macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, due to the improved fibrin-binding and retention capacity of CREKA-sEVs, they enhanced the bone repair substantially in the rat femoral defect model.

RNA interference therapy is an emerging epigenetic treatment, and we found that miR-20a could enhance osteogenesis. Moreover, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) were utilized as nanoscale carriers for the protection and transportation of miR-20a (sEV-20a). In this study, we intended to determine whether sEVs overexpressing miR-20a could exert a superior effect on osteoporotic bone defects and the underlying mechanism. Methods For evaluating the effect of sEV-20a on osteogenesis, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed. In vitro, we first showed that miR-20a was upregulated in the osteogenic process and overexpressed sEVs with miR-20a by the transfection method. Then, the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation abilities of hBM-MSCs treated with sEV-20a were detected by CCK-8 assays, alkaline phosphatase staining and alizarin red staining, qRT-PCR, and western blot. In vivo, we established an osteoporotic bone defect model and evaluated the effect of sEV-20a on bone formation by micro-CT, sequential fluorescent labeling, and histological analysis. To further explore the mechanism, we applied a bioinformatics method to identify the potential target of miR-20a. Results In vitro, sEV-20a was successfully established and proved to promote the migration and osteogenesis of hBM-MSCs. In vivo, sEV-20a promoted osteointegration in an osteoporotic rat model. To further elucidate the related mechanism, we proved that miR-20a could enhance osteogenesis by targeting BAMBI. Conclusions Collectively, the in vitro and in vivo results confirmed that MSC-derived sEV-20a therapy effectively promoted osteoporotic porous titanium alloy osteointegration via pro-osteogenic effects by targeting BAMBI.","2021-06-16","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:42","348","","1","12","","Stem Cell Res.

Here, we confirmed that hypoxic precondition could induce enhanced secretion of exosomes from stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) via comprehensive proteomics analysis, and the corresponding hypoxic exosomes (H-Exo) exhibited superior potential in promoting cellular angiogenesis and osteogenesis via the significant up-regulation in focal adhesion, VEGF signaling pathway, and thyroid hormone synthesis. Then, we developed a platform technology enabling the effective delivery of hypoxic exosomes with sustained release kinetics to irregular-shaped bone defects via injection. This platform is based on a simple adsorbing technique, where exosomes are adsorbed onto the surface of injectable porous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres with bioinspired polydopamine (PDA) coating (PMS-PDA microspheres). The PMS-PDA microspheres could effectively adsorb exosomes, show sustained release of H-Exo for 21 days with high bioactivity, and induce vascularized bone regeneration in 5-mm rat calvarial defect.

Although autologous and allogeneic bone grafts are generally considered ""gold standard"" treatments for bone defects, these approaches may result in various complications. Furthermore, safety considerations of gene- and cell-based therapies require further clarification and approval from regulatory authorities. Therefore, developing new therapeutic biomaterials that can empower endogenous regenerative properties to accelerate bone repair and regeneration is of great significance. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) comprise a heterogeneous population of naturally derived nanoparticles that play a critical role in mediating cell-cell communication. The vast amount of biological processes that EVs are involved in, such as immune modulation, senescence, and angiogenesis, and the versatility of manner in which they can influence the behavior of recipient cells make EVs an interesting source for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Advancement of knowledge in the fields of immunology and cell biology has sparked the exploration of the potential of EVs in the field of regenerative medicine. EVs travel between cells and deliver functional cargoes, such as proteins and RNAs, thereby regulating the recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation of recipient cells. Numerous studies have demonstrated the pivotal role of EVs in tissue regeneration both in vitro and in vivo. In this chapter, we will outline current knowledge surrounding EVs, summarize their functional roles in bone regenerative medicine, and elaborate on potential application and challenges of EV-integrated biomaterials in bone tissue engineering.","2020","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:42","97-108","","","1250","","","","","","","","Springer-Verlag Singapore Pte Ltd","Singapore","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","DOI: 10.1007/978-981-15-3262-7_7 ISSN: 0065-2598, 2214-8019 Journal Abbreviation: Adv.Exp.Med.Biol.

In the clinical management of bone diseases, there is a paradigm shift in using local drugs at the injury site; however, the dead space created during the surgical debridement of necrotic bone and soft tissues (periosteum and underlying muscle) leads to ineffective bone formation, thereby leading to secondary complications, and thus calls for better regenerative approaches. In this study, we have utilized an exosomecarrier along with a Cissus quadrangularis (CQ) extract-laden antioxidant herbal membrane for simultaneously managing the periosteum as well as bone formation in the tumor resection model of osteosarcoma. We initially evaluated the efficacy of scaffolds for in vitro mineralization and bone formation. To examine the in vivo effectiveness, we developed a human osteosarcoma cell line (Saos-2)-induced tumor xenograft model with a critical-sized bone defect. The findings revealed that doxorubicin released from NC was successful in killing the tumor cells and was present even after 30 days of implantation. Additionally, the incorporation of exosomes aided the bone formation, resulting in around a 2.6-fold increase in the bone volume compared to the empty group as evaluated by micro-CT. The herbal membrane assisted in the development of periosteum and mineralizing bone callous as validated through histological and immunofluorescence analysis. Thus, our findings describe a one-step biomaterial-based cell-free approach to regenerate bone in osteosarcoma and prevent further fracture due to the complete development of periosteum and lost bone.","2023-02-07","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:42","","","","","","ACS Appl.

For in vivo evaluation, we randomly divided 24 rats into three groups. The rat calvarial bone defects were treated as follows: (1) Control group: defects without any treatment, (2) scaffold group: defects treated with scaffold only, (3) scaffold+exo group: defects treated with scaffold enriched with exosomes (1 & mu;g/& mu;l ,150 & mu;g/per rat). Eight-and 12-weeks post-surgery, half of the animals were sacrificed and bone regeneration was examined through micro-computerized tomography (& mu;-CT), histological staining, and immunohistochemistry (IHC).Results: Quantitative analysis based on & mu;-CT scan images at 8 and 12 weeks post-implantation clearly indicated that healing rate for defects that were filled with scaffold enriched with exosome was significantly higher than defects filled with scaffold without exosome. The H & E and Masson staining results revealed that more new bone-like form developed in the scaffold+exo group than that in control and scaffold groups. Further, IHC staining for osteocalcin and CD31 confirmed that more bone healing in the scaffold+exo group at 12 weeks could be associated with osteogenesis and angiogenesis concurrently.Conclusion: In the present study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of PAA/triCaPNPs scaffold as a carrier of human UC-MSC-derived exosome to achieve the exosome-controlled release on calvarial bone defect. The in vivo results indicated that the exosome-enriched scaffold could effectively minify the defect area and improve the bone healing in rat model, and as such it could be an option for exosome-based therapy.","2023-07-19","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:42","","","","","","BioImpacts","Poly (acrylic acid)/tricalcium phosphate nanoparticles scaffold enriched with exosomes for cell-free therapy in bone tissue engineering","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 16 Place: Tabriz Publisher: Tabriz Univ Medical Sciences & Health Services Web of Science ID: WOS:001036174300001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\BR4I5DC3\Moradi et al. - 2023 - Poly (acrylic acid)tricalcium phosphate nanoparti.pdf","","","ANGIOGENESIS; BEHAVIOR; CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE; Cell-free Therapy; Critical-Sized Bone Defect; DRUG-DELIVERY; GRAFT; HYDROGEL; PAA; POLY(ACRYLIC ACID); Preclinical Imaging; PROTEINS; REGENERATION; tricalcium Phosphate Nanoparticles; UCMSC-Exosome; UMBILICAL-CORD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report the construction and evaluation of a novel cell-free tissue-engineered bone that successfully accelerated the restoration of critical-sized mouse calvarial defects through combining exosomes derived from human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolds. The exosomes were immobilized on the polydopamine-coating PLGA (PLGA/pDA) scaffolds under mild chemical conditions. Specifically, we investigated the effects of hASC-derived exosomes on the osteogenic, proliferation, and migration capabilities of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in vitro and optimized their osteoinductive effects through osteogenic induction. Furthermore, an in vitro assay showed exosomes could release from PLGA/pDA scaffold slowly and consistently and in vivo results showed this cell-free system enhanced bone regeneration significantly, at least partially through its osteoinductive effects and capacities of promoting mesenchymal stem cells migration and homing in the newly formed bone tissue. Therefore, overall results demonstrated that our novel cell-free system comprised of hASC-derived exosomes and PLGA/pDA scaffold provides a new therapeutic paradigm for bone tissue engineering and showed promising potential in repairing bone defects.","2018-02-14","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:42","5240-5254","","6","10","","ACS Appl.

However, the mechanisms responsible for the coupling between OCs and OBs have not been fully elucidated. Herein, we first validate that secreted extracellular vesicles by osteoclasts (OC-EVs) promote osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and further demonstrate the efficacy of osteoclasts and their secreted EVs in treating tibial bone defects. Furthermore, we show that OC-EVs contain several osteogenesis-promoting proteins as cargo. By employing proteomic and functional analysis, we reveal that mature osteoclasts secrete thrombin cleaved phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) through extracellular vesicles which triggers MSCs osteogenic differentiation into OBs by activating Transforming Growth Factor 131 (TGF131) and Smad family member 3 (SMAD3) signaling. In conclusion, our findings prove an important role of SPP1, present as cargo in OC-derived EVs, in signaling to MSCs and driving their differentiation into OBs. This biological mechanism implies a paradigm shift regarding the role of osteoclasts and their signaling toward the treatment of skeletal disorders which require bone formation.","2023-12","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:42","122367","","","303","","Biomaterials","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 17 Place: Oxford Publisher: Elsevier Sci Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:001108494800001","","","","","Bone regeneration; Extracellular vesicles; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; Osteoclasts; OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; OSTEOPONTIN; RESORPTION; Secreted phosphoprotein 1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we investigated the effects of the local administration of muscle cell-derived EVs on bone repair in control and streptozotocin-treated diabetic female mice. Muscle cell-derived EVs (Myo-EVs) were isolated from the conditioned medium from mouse muscle C2C12 cells by ultracentrifugation, after which Myo-EVs and gelatin hydrogel sheets were transplanted on femoral bone defect sites. The local administration of Myo-EVs significantly improved delayed bone repair that was induced by the diabetic state in mice 9 days after surgery. Moreover, this administration significantly enhanced the ratio of bone volume to tissue volume at the damaged sites 9 days after surgery in the control mice. Moreover, the local administration of Myo-EVs significantly blunted the number of Osterix-positive cells that were suppressed by the diabetic state at the damage sites after bone injury in mice. Additionally, Myo-EVs significantly blunted the mRNA levels of Osterix and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and ALP activity was suppressed by advanced glycation end product 3 in ST2 cells that were treated with bone morphogenetic protein-2. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that the local administration of Myo-EVs improves delayed bone repair that is induced by the diabetic state through an enhancement of osteoblastic differentiation in female mice.","2023","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:43","161-171","","2","70","","Endocr.

Here, we found that Nidogen1-enriched EV (EV-NID1) derived from BMSCs interferes with the formation and assembly of focal adhesions (FAs) by targeting myosin-10, thereby reducing the adhesion strength of rat arterial endothelial cells (RAECs) to the extracellular matrix (ECM), and enhancing the migration and angiogenesis potential of RAECs. Moreover, by delivery with composite hydrogel, EV-NID1 is demonstrated to promote angiogenesis and bone regeneration in rat femoral defects.

Recently, the development of biomaterials with the addiction of stem cells is giving promising results for the treatment of bone defects. In particular, it was demonstrated that scaffolds enriched with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and/or their derivatives, such as conditioned medium (CM) and extracellular vesicles (EVs), may improve bone regeneration. Moreover, given the deep link between osteogenesis and angiogenesis, a successful approach must also take into consideration the development of vascularization. In this work we evaluated the bone regeneration capacity of a collagen membrane (3D-COL) enriched with human periodontal-ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) and CM or EVs or EVs engineered with polyethylenimine (PEI-EVs) in rats subjected to a calvarial defect. We evaluated also their capacity to induce angiogenic factors. At first, in vitro results showed an increased expression of osteogenic markers in hPDLSCs cultured with the 3D-COL and PEI-EVs, associated also with the increased protein levels of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). The increased expression of these proteins was confirmed also in vivo in rats implanted with the 3D-COL enriched with hPDLSCs and PEI-EVs. Moreover, histological examination evidenced in this group of rats the activation of bone regeneration and of the vascularization process. Also MicroCT imaging with morphometric analysis confirmed in rats transplanted with 3D-COL enriched with hPDLSCs and PEI-EVs an important regenerative process and a better integration level. All together, these results evidenced that the 3D-COL enriched with hPDLSCs and PEI-EVs may promote bone regeneration of calvaria defects, associated also with an increased vascularization.","2019-04-30","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:43","512","","","10","","Front.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and a moderate inflammatory response at the prosthesis-bone interface play an important role in osteointegration. Here, we developed microarc oxide titanium implant loaded engineered exosomes (S-Exos) to promote osseointegration at the prosthesis-bone interface. First, Smurf1-shRNA was transferred into the BMSCs using a viral vector to prepare S-Exos, which were subsequently immobilized to the microarc oxide titanium implant surface with positively charged polyethyle-neimine. The immobilized S-Exos could be slowly and uniformly released and subsequently phagocytosed by BMSCs and macrophages. Once the S-Exos were phagocytosed, they could simultaneously activate the BMP/Smad signaling pathway in the BMSCs and promote macrophage M2 polarization, both of which enhance osseointegration. Specifically, this S-Exos coating exhibits a dual effect of promoting osseointegration, including the osseointegration of BMSCs by activating the BMP/Smad signaling pathway and the macrophage M2 polarization promoting osseointegration. In summary, the construction of S-Exos modified microarc oxide titanium implants could provide a new method for promoting osteointegration between the prosthesis and host bone in revision total hip arthroplasty.","2022-10-19","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:43","46161-46175","","41","14","","ACS Appl.

In this study, we evaluated whether exosomes derived from bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) preconditioned with a low dose of dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG), DMOG-MSC-Exos, exert superior proangiogenic activity in bone regeneration and the underlying mechanisms involved. Methods To investigate the effects of these exosomes, scratch wound healing, cell proliferation, and tube formation assays were performed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). To test the effects in vivo, a critical-sized calvarial defect rat model was established. Eight weeks after the procedure, histological/histomorphometrical analysis was performed to measure bone regeneration, and micro-computerized tomography was used to measure bone regeneration and neovascularization. Results DMOG-MSC-Exos activated the AKT/mTOR pathway to stimulate angiogenesis in HUVECs. This contributed to bone regeneration and angiogenesis in the critical-sized calvarial defect rat model in vivo. Conclusions Low doses of DMOG trigger exosomes to exert enhanced proangiogenic activity in cell-free therapeutic applications.","2019-11-20","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:43","335","","1","10","","Stem Cell Res.

A rat model of femoral bone defects was used to demonstrate that the exosomes derived from SMCs (SMC-Exos) and PCs (PC-Exos) can accelerate bone formation in vivo. Furthermore, we present a preliminary discussion of the possible functional components involved in the effects of SMC-Exos and PC-Exos on bone regeneration.

This study investigated whether exosomes from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC-Exos) plays an immunomodulatory role in traumatic bone defects and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. Methods ADSC-Exos were loaded by a biomaterial named gelatine nanoparticles (GNPs), physical and chemical properties were analysed by zeta potential, surface topography and rheology. A rat model of skull defect was used for our in vivo studies, and micro-CT and histological staining were used to analyse histological changes in the bone defect area. RT-qPCR and western blotting were performed to verify that ADSC-Exos could regulate M1/M2 macrophage polarization. MicroRNA (miRNA) array analysis was conducted to determine the miRNA expression profiles of ADSC-Exos. After macrophages were treated with a miR-451a mimic, miR-451a inhibitor and ISO-1, the relative expression of genes and proteins was measured by RT-qPCR and western blotting. Results In vivo, micro-CT and histological staining showed that exosome-loaded GNPs (GNP-Exos) hydrogel, with good biocompatibility and strong mechanical adaptability, exhibited immunomodulatory effect mainly by regulating macrophage immunity and promoting bone tissue healing. Immunofluorescence further indicated that ADSC-Exos reduced M1 marker (iNOS) expression and increased M2 marker (CD206) expression. Moreover, in vitro studies, western blotting and RT-qPCR showed that ADSC-Exos inhibited M1 macrophage marker expression and upregulated M2 macrophage marker expression. MiR-451a was enriched in ADSC-Exos and targeted macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Macrophages treated with the miR-451a mimic showed lower expression of M1 markers. In contrast, miR-451a inhibitor treatment upregulated the expression of M1 markers and downregulated the expression of M2 markers, while ISO-1 (a MIF inhibitor) treatment upregulated miR-451a expression and downregulated M1 macrophage marker expression. Conclusion GNP-Exos can effectively regulate bone immune metabolism and further promote bone healing partly through immune regulation of miR-451a, which may provide a therapeutic direction for bone repair.","2022-04-08","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:43","149","","1","13","","Stem Cell Res.

The recent progress in tissue engineering technologies and stem cell biology has significantly promoted the development of regenerative reconstruction of jawbone defects. The multiple trophic activities of extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may play a critical role in their therapeutic effects. Accumulating evidence has shown the promise of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in bone regeneration, but less is known about the regenerative effects of DPSC-EVs on jawbone defects. The purpose of this study is to explore the osteogenic effects of DPSC-EVs on jawbone marrow-derived MSCs (JB-MSCs) in vitro and their osteoinductive effects in a mandibular bone defect model in rats. Our results showed that JB-MSCs could efficiently uptake DPSC-EVs, which in turn significantly promoted the expression of osteogenic genes, such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteocalcin (OCN), as well as the osteogenic differentiation capability of JB-MSCs. Meanwhile, we found that the pro-osteogenic effect in vitro induced by DPSC-EVs was comparable to that induced by BMP-2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2), currently the only Food and Drug Administration-approved osteoinductive growth factor. In vivo, animals that were locally treated with DPSC-EVs laden with a commercially available collagen membrane exhibited a relatively fast wound closure and increased new bone density at the mandible defects. Our results provide evidence for the osteogenic and osteoinductive effects of DPSC-EVs on jawbone regeneration. Due to the accessibility, rapid proliferation, and osteogenic propensity of DPSCs, DPSC-EVs may represent a safe cell-free therapeutic approach for craniofacial bone regeneration.","2023-03","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:44","313-321","","3","102","","J.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs)-mediated acellular tissue regeneration is a promising alternative to stem cell based transplants. Although neural EGFL-like 1 (Nell1) is known to contribute to the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), it remains unknown whether EVs are involved in this process. Here, we present that EVs derived from Nell1-modified BMSCs (Nell1/EVs) have a stronger ability to promote BMSC osteogenesis owing to miR-25-5p downregulation. MiR-25-5p inhibits osteogenesis by targeting Smad2 and suppressing the SMAD and extracellular signal-related kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathway activation. In addition, we demonstrate that the 3D-Nell1/EV-hydrogel system is beneficial for bone regeneration in vivo, probably stemming from a slow, continuous release and high concentration of EVs in the bone defect area. Thus, our results have shown the potential of Nell1/EVs as a novel acellular bone regeneration strategy. Mechanistically, the identification of miR-25-5p-SMAD2 signaling axis expands the knowledge of Nell1/EVs induced osteogenesis.","2022-11","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:44","457-470","","","17","","Bioact.

Here, we evaluated intracellular communication through small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) and its effects on endogenous bone regeneration mediated by biomimetic intrafibrillarly mineralized collagen (IMC). After implantation in the bone defect area, IMC generated more neobone and recruited more mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) than did extrafibrillarly mineralized collagen (EMC). More CD63(+)CD90(+) and CD63(+)CD163(+) cells were detected in the defect area in the IMC group than in the EMC group. To determine the functional roles of sEVs, extracellular vesicles from macrophages cultured on different mineralized collagen were isolated, and they showed no morphological differences. However, macrophage-derived sEVs in the IMC group showed an enhanced Young's modulus and exerted beneficial effects on the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow MSCs by increasing the expression of the osteoblastic differentiation markers BMP2, BGLAP, COL1, and OSX and calcium nodule formation. Mechanistically, sEVs from IMC-treated macrophages facilitated MSC osteogenesis through the BMP2/Smad5 pathway, and blocking sEV secretion with GW4869 significantly impaired MSC proliferative, immunomodulative and osteogenic potential. Taken together, these findings show that macrophage-derived sEVs may serve as an emerging functional tool in biomaterial-mediated endogenous bone regeneration.","2020-11-30","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:44","33","","1","12","","Int.

This study shows that after TBI, injured neurons, mainly those in the hippocampus, release osteogenic microRNA (miRNA)-enriched small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), which targeted osteoprogenitors in bone to stimulate bone formation. We show that miR-328a-3p and miR-150-5p, enriched in the sEVs after TBI, promote osteogenesis by directly targeting the 3 ' UTR of FOXO4 or CBL, respectively, and hydrogel carrying miR-328a-3p-containing sEVs efficiently repaires bone defects in rats. Importantly, increased fibronectin expression on sEVs surface contributes to targeting of osteoprogenitors in bone by TBI sEVs, thereby implying that modification of the sEVs surface fibronectin could be used in bone-targeted drug delivery. Together, our work unveils a role of central regulation in bone formation and a clear link between injured neurons and osteogenitors, both in animals and clinical settings.

Overall, the integrated repair of the structure and function of the osteochondral (OC) unit is very important. Some studies have demonstrated that the differentiation of cartilage is significantly enhanced by reducing the intake of nutrients such as lipids. This study demonstrates that using starvation can effectively optimize the therapeutic effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). A hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel containing starved BMSCs-EVs displayed continuous release for more than 3 weeks and significantly promoted the proliferation and biosynthesis of chondrocytes around the defect regulated by the forkhead-box class O (FOXO) pathway. When combined with vascular inhibitors, the hydrogel inhibited cartilage hypertrophy and facilitated the regeneration of hyaline cartilage. A porous methacrylate gelatine (GelMA)-based hydrogel containing calcium salt loaded with thrombin rapidly promoted haematoma formation upon contact with the bone marrow cavity to quickly block the pores and prevent the blood vessels in the bone marrow cavity from invading the cartilage layer. Furthermore, the haematoma could be used as nutrients to accelerate bone survival. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that the multifunctional lineage-specific hydrogel promoted the integrated regeneration of cartilage/subchondral bone. Thus, this hydrogel may represent a new strategy for osteochondral regeneration and repair.","2023-12","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:45","100800","","","23","","Mater.

In this study, we aimed to synthesize a new type of coralline hydroxyapatite (CHA)/silk fibroin (SF)/glycol chitosan (GCS)/difunctionalized polyethylene glycol (DF-PEG) self-healing hydrogel and to evaluate the therapeutic effects of this novel self-healing hydrogel as a human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSC)-derived exosome carrier on bone defects in SD rat. Methods HucMSCs were isolated from fetal umbilical cord tissue and characterized by surface antigen analysis and pluripotent differentiationin vitro. The cell supernatant after ultracentrifugation was collected to isolate exosomes, which were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and western blot analysis.In vitrocell induction experiments were performed to observe the effects of hucMSC-derived exosomes on the biological behavior of mouse osteoblast progenitor cells (mOPCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The CHA/SF/GCS/DF-PEG hydrogels were prepared using DF-PEG as the gel factor and then structural and physical properties were characterized. HucMSCs-derived exosomes were added to the hydrogel and their effects were evaluated in SD rats with induced femoral condyle defect. These effects were analyzed by X-ray and micro-CT imaging and H&E, Masson and immunohistochemistry staining. Results HucMSC-derived exosomes can promote osteogenic differentiation of mOPCs and promote the proliferation and migration of HUVECs. The CHA/SF/GCS/DF-PEG hydrogel has a high self-healing capacity, perfect surface morphology and the precipitated CHA crystals have a small size and low crystallinity similar to natural bone minerals. The MTT results showed that the hydrogel was non-toxic and have a good biocompatibility. Thein vivostudies have shown that the hydrogel containing exosomes could effectively promote healing of rat bone defect. The histological analysis revealed more new bone tissue and morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) in the hydrogel-exosome group. In addition, the hydrogel-exosome group had the highest microvessel density. Conclusion A self-healing CHA/SF/GCS/DF-PEG hydrogel was successfully prepared. The hydrogel has excellent comprehensive properties and is expected to become a new type of bone graft material. This hydrogel has the effect of promoting bone repair, which is more significant after the addition of hucMSC-derived exosomes.","2020-09-10","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:45","564731","","","8","","Front.

Exosomes emerge as essential paracrine factors of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that mediated tissue regeneration. Here, we investigated the potential of exosomes secreted by periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) as therapeutics for the bone defect in periodontitis. Exosomes secreted from PDLSCs derived from healthy periodontal ligaments (h-PDLSCs) and their function were evaluated on PDLSCs isolated from the inflammatory periodontal ligament of periodontitis patients (i-PDLSCs). Treatment of exosomes of h-PDLSCs led to an increase in the formation of mineralized nodules and the expressions of osteogenic genes and proteins in i-PDL SCs. Mechanistically, h-PDL SCs-exosomes suppressed the over-activation of canonical Wnt signaling to recover the osteogenic differentiation capac-ity of i-PDLSCs. To evaluate the therapeutic of exosomes on inflammatory bone loss, h-PDLSCs-exosomes loaded with Matrigel or beta-TCP were employed to repair bone defects in rat models of periodontitis. Com-pared to the vehicle-treated control group, h-PDLSCs-exosomes-treated rats resulted in more bone forma-tion in the defect of alveolar bone. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that exosomes derived from healthy PDLSCs could rescue the osteogenesis capacity of endogenous stem cells under an inflammatory environment and promote regeneration of alveolar bone. Our findings suggest that MSCs-derived exosome is an effective and practical cell-free MSC therapeutic for the treatment of periodontitis. Statement of significance There is no effective treatment to repair inflammatory bone loss in periodontitis. As essential paracrine factors of PDLSCs, exosomes might mediate tissue regeneration during stem cell therapy. Here, we re-ported that exosomes secreted from healthy PDLSCs promoted the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs derived from periodontitis tissue. Healthy PDLSCs-exosomes treatment resulted in accelerated bone for-mation in the defect of alveolar bone in rat models of periodontitis. Mechanistically, h-PDLSCs-exosomes suppressed the over-activation of canonical Wnt signaling to recover the osteogenic differentiation ca-pacity of inflammatory PDLSCs. These findings suggest that MSCs-derived exosome is an effective and practical cell-free MSC therapeutic for the treatment of periodontitis. (C) 2021 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Tissue engineering strategies aimed at the restoration of function face challenges in material selection, synthesis technique, and choice of bioactive factor release in combination with all aforementioned facets. Biomimetic nanofibrous (NF) scaffolds are attractive vehicles for tissue engineering because of their ability to promote endogenous bone regeneration by mimicking the shape and chemistry of natural bone extracellular matrix (ECM). To date, several techniques for generation of biomimetic NF scaffolds have been discovered, each possessing several advantages and drawbacks. This spotlight highlights two of the more popular techniques for biomimetic NF scaffold synthesis, electrospinning and thermally induced phase separation (TIPS), covering development from inception in each technique as well as discussing the most recent innovations in each fabrication method.","2020-10-19","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:45","6538-6545","","10","3","","ACS Appl.

However, it remains uncertain whether this distraction osteogenesis (DO) process induced by TS involves the pivotal coupling of angiogenesis and osteogenesis mediated by type H endothelial cells (THECs). In this study, it is demonstrated that the Ilizarov technique induces the formation of a metaphysis-like architecture composed of THECs, leading to segmental bone regeneration during the DO process. Mechanistically, cell-matrix interactions-mediated activation of yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) transcriptionally upregulates the expression of Notch1 and Delta-like ligand 4, which act as direct positive regulators of THECs phenotype, in bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs) upon TS stimulation. Simultaneously, the Notch intracellular domain enhances YAP/TAZ activity by transcriptionally upregulating YAP expression and stabilizing TAZ protein, thus establishing the YAP/TAZ-Notch circuit. Additionally, TS-stimulated BMECs secrete exosomes enriched with vital molecules in this positive feedback pathway, which can be utilized to promote segmental bone defect healing, mimicking the therapeutic effects of Ilizarov technique. The findings advance the understanding of TS-induced segmental bone regeneration and establish the foundation for innovative biological therapeutic strategies aimed at activating THECs. Tensile stress-induced activation of yes-associated protein/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif-Notch positive feedback loop specifies type H endothelial cells (THEC) during distraction osteogenesis. Vital molecules involved in this circuit are enriched in exosomes for intercellular communication of regenerative signals, which can be further utilized to promote segmental bone regeneration through THEC activation, mimicking the therapeutic effects of the Ilizarov technique.image","2024-01-15","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","","","","","","Adv.

In this study, human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) were co-cultured with human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs), and osteoblastic phenotypes were found to be enhanced in co-cultures compared with monocultures of hDPSCs or hADSCs. Furthermore, GW4869, an inhibitor of extracellular vesicle (EV) formation, suppressed the mineralization of co-cultured cells. Studies indicate that the therapeutic potential of DPSCs is realized through paracrine action, in which EVs play an important role. To study their role, we successfully obtained and identified hDPSC-derived extracellular vesicles (hDPSC-EVs), and further investigated their effects on hADSCs and the underlying mechanism. hADSCs were stimulated with hDPSC-EVs, which were found to promote the migration and mineralization of hADSCs. Moreover, hDPSC-EVs promoted osteogenic differentiation by enhancing the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and JNK in hADSCs. To investigate the specific proteins in EVs that might play a role in hADSC osteogenic differentiation, we performed proteomic analysis of hDPSC-EVs. We determined the top 30 enriched pathways, which notably included the insulin signaling pathway. The number of genes enriched in the insulin signaling pathway was the largest, in addition to the ""protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum"" term. The MAPK cascade is a typical downstream pathway mediating insulin signaling. To further study the effects of hDPSC-EVs on maxillofacial bone regeneration, we used hDPSC-EVs as a cell-free biomaterial in a model of mandibular defects in rats. To assess the therapeutic potential of EVs, we analyzed their proteome. Animal experiments demonstrated that hDPSC-EVs promoted the regeneration of bone defects. Overall, these results highlight the potential of hDPSC-EVs to induce lineage specific differentiation of hADSCs.

The results showed that Gr-Ti scaffolds have low toxicity and good biocompatibility, which can promote the adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs. Exos played a role in promoting osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs: the mRNA levels of RUNX2, ALP, and Osterix in the Gr-Ti/Exos group were significantly higher than those in the Gr-Ti group, which process related to the Wnt signaling pathway. Gr-Ti scaffolds with ADSCs and ADSC-derived Exos successfully repaired rabbit mandibular defects.

One is decomposition by lysosomes, and the other is the generation of exosomes that are transported out through the transmembrane. On the other hand, M2 macrophages promote the formation of local vascularization and provide necessary support for the repair of bone defects. To provide a new idea for the treatment of bone defects, the purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of WKYMVm (Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-D-Met-NH2) peptide on the secretion of exosomes from murine bone marrow-derived MSCs (mBMSCs) and the effect of exosomes on the polarization of M2 macrophages.MethodsThe WKYMVm peptide was used to activate the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) pathway in mBMSCs. First, we used Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) to detect the cytotoxic effect of WKYMVm peptide on mBMSCs. Second, we used western blotting (WB) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect the expression of interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) and transcription factor EB (TFEB) in mBMSCs. Then, we detected lysosomal activity using a lysozyme activity assay kit. Third, we used an exosome extraction kit and western blotting to detect the content of exosomes secreted by mBMSCs. Fourth, we used immunofluorescence and western blotting to count the number of polarized M2 macrophages. Finally, we used an inhibitor to block miRNA-146 in exosomes secreted by mBMSCs and counted the number of polarized M2 macrophages.ResultsWe first found that the WKYMVm peptide had no toxic effect on mBMSCs at a concentration of 1 mu mol/L. Second, we found that when the FPR2 pathway was activated by the WKYMVm peptide in mBMSCs, ISG15 and TFEB expression was decreased, leading to increased secretion of exosomes. We also found that lysosomal activity was decreased when the FPR2 pathway was activated by the WKYMVm peptide in mBMSCs. Third, we demonstrated that exosomes secreted by mBMSCs promote the polarization of M2 macrophages. Moreover, all these effects can be blocked by the WRWWWW (WRW4, H-Trp-Arg-Trp-Trp-Trp-Trp-OH) peptide, an inhibitor of the FPR2 pathway. Finally, we confirmed the effect of miRNA-146 in exosomes secreted by mBMSCs on promoting the polarization of M2 macrophages.ConclusionOur findings demonstrated the potential value of the WKYMVm peptide in promoting the secretion of exosomes by mBMSCs and eventually leading to M2 macrophage polarization. We believe that our study could provide a research basis for the clinical treatment of bone defects.","2021-03-03","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","171","","1","16","","J.

However, the treatment duration is undesirably lengthy, especially in elderly patients. Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-Exos) could exert the beneficial effects while avoiding the possible complications of stem cell transplantation. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of MSC-Exos on bone regeneration during DO in older rats. Exosomes were isolated from the supernatants of young bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) through ultra-centrifugation, and characterized using transmission electron microscopy, western blot, and tunable resistive pulse sensing analysis. The effects of MSC-Exos on the proliferation and differentiation of older BMSCs were evaluated using CCK-8 assay, ALP and ARS staining, and qRT-PCR. Unilateral tibial DO model was established on older Sprague-Dawley rats and MSC-Exos or phosphate buffer saline was locally injected into the distraction gaps after distraction weekly. Bone regeneration were evaluated using X-ray, Micro-CT, mechanical test, and histological staining. The MSC-Exos were round or cup-shaped vesicles ranging from 60 to 130 nm in diameter and expressed markers including CD9, CD63, and TSG101. The in vitro results indicated that MSC-Exos could enhance the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of older BMSCs. Bone regeneration was markedly accelerated in rats treated with MSC-Exos according to the results of X-ray, micro-CT, and histological analysis. The distracted tibias from the MSC-Exos group also demonstrated better mechanical properties. These results suggest that MSC-Exos promote DO-mediated bone regeneration in older rats through enhancing the proliferation and osteogenic capacity of BMSCs.","2020-05","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","2024-01-26 18:22:46","509-517","","5","106","","Calcif.

In this study, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-derived exosomes were loaded with photothermal material layered black phosphorus (BP) modified poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) thermosensitive hydrogels to explore their effects on bone defect repair. In vitro, it was confirmed that the local high heat of nano-BP irradiated using a near-infrared (NIR) laser could trigger the reversible cascade reaction of hydrogels, and that the mechanical contraction of hydrogels led to the controllable release of a large number of exosomes along with the release of water molecules. Furthermore, in vitro investigations demonstrated that BP hydrogels loaded with BMSC-derived exosomes had favourable biocompatibility and could promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Experiments conducted in vivo confirmed that this system significantly promoted bone regeneration. Therefore, the results of our study indicated that the nanoplatform based on BP thermosensitive hydrogels could provide a new clinical treatment strategy for controlled release and on-demand drug delivery, while the cell-free system composed of BMSC-derived exosomes had great application potential in bone tissue repair with the synergism of BP.","2023-05-24","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:11","4396-4407","","20","11","","J.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEV) have been shown to exert therapeutic effects on bone defects. However, cultured MSCs are typically exposed to normoxia (21% O2) in vitro, which differs largely from the oxygen concentration in vivo under hypoxic conditions. It is largely unknown whether sEV derived from dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) cultured under hypoxic conditions (Hypo-sEV) exert better therapeutic effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory osteolysis than those cultured under normoxic conditions (Nor-sEV) by simultaneously inhibiting the macrophage inflammatory response and osteoclastogenesis. In this study, we show that hypoxia significantly induces the release of sEV from DPSCs. Moreover, Hypo-sEV exhibit significantly improved efficacy in promoting M2 macrophage polarization and suppressing osteoclast formation to alleviate LPS-induced inflammatory calvarial bone loss compared with Nor-sEV. Mechanistically, hypoxia preconditioning markedly alters the miRNA profiles of DPSC-sEV. MiR-210-3p is enriched in Hypo-sEV, and can simultaneously induce M2 macrophage generation and inhibit osteoclasto-genesis by targeting NF-kappa B1 p105, which attenuates osteolysis.

After their in vivo application, MSCs undergo apoptosis and release apoptotic vesicles (apoVs). This study investigates the role of apoVs derived from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs) in bone metabolism and the molecular mechanism of the observed effects. The results show that apoVs can promote osteogenesis and inhibit osteoclast formation in vitro and in vivo. ApoVs may therefore attenuate the bone loss caused by primary and secondary osteoporosis and stimulate bone regeneration in areas of bone defect. The mechanisms responsible for apoV-induced bone regeneration include the release of miR1324, which inhibit expression of the target gene Sorting Nexin 14 (SNX14) and thus activate the SMAD1/5 pathway in target cells. Given that MSC-derived apoVs are easily obtained and stored, with low risks of immunological rejection and neoplastic transformation, The findings suggest a novel therapeutic strategy to treat bone loss, including via cell-free approaches to bone tissue engineering.","2023-04","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:11","","","16","19","","Small","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 16 Place: Weinheim Publisher: Wiley-V C H Verlag Gmbh Web of Science ID: WOS:000915953600001","","","","","5 signaling axis; apoptotic vesicles; bone metabolism; cell-free therapy; DELIVERY; DIFFERENTIATION; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; FATE COMMITMENT; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; HOMEOSTASIS; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; miR1324; REGENERATION; ROLES; SMAD1; SNX14; TISSUE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current research on the mechanism of stem cells on the repair of damaged tissue suggest an important role of a cell-to-cell communication through secreted extracellular vesicles, mainly represented by exosomes. To enhance the scarce knowledge on the functional role of exosomes we compared as a first step different techniques to isolate and identify exosomes from the supernatant of equine adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells for further characterization and usage in functional assays. Results: It was possible to obtain exosomes secreted from equine adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells with three common techniques: a stepwise ultracentrifugation at 100.000 g, an ultrafiltration with 3 kDa exclusion membranes and a charge-based precipitation method. The mean sizes and amounts of exosomes isolated with the different techniques were measured by the nanoparticle tracking analysis. The diameter ranged between 116.2 nm (ultracentrifugation), 453.1 nm (precipitation) and 178.7 nm (ultrafiltration), the counts of particles / ml ranged between 9.6 x 10(8) (ultracentrifugation), 2.02 x 10(9) (precipitation) and 52.5 x 10(9) (ultrafiltration). Relevant marker for exosomes, tetraspanins CD9, CD63 and CD81 were detectable by immunofluorescence staining of the investigated exosomes secreting mesenchymal stem cells. In addition, transmission electron microscopy and immunogold labeling with CD9 and CD90 was performed to display the morphological shape of exosomes and existence of marker relevant for exosomes (CD9) and mesenchymal stem cells (CD90). Western blot analysis of CD9 and CD90 of exosomes ensured the specificity of the rare available respectively cross reacting antibodies against equine antigens. Conclusion: Exosomes generated by equine mesenchymal stem cells can be obtained by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation in an equal quality for in vitro experiments. Especially for later therapeutic usage we recommend ultrafiltration due to a higher concentration without aggregation of extracellular vesicles in comparison to exosomes obtained by ultracentrifugation.","2019-01-28","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:11","42","","","15","","BMC Vet.

In order to overcome the disadvantages of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in cell therapy, such as unexpected differentiation leading to tumorization, immune rejection, and other side ef-fects, EVs derived from MSCs (MSC-EVs) with the tissue regenerative function have been studied as new cell-free therapeutics. However, therapeutic applications of EVs require overcoming several challenges. First, the pro-duction efficiency of MSC-EVs should be increased at least as much as the quantity of them are required to their clinical application; second, MSC-EVs needs to show various functionality further, thereby increasing tissue regeneration efficiency. In this study, we treated tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a biological derivative known to regulate cholesterol, to MSCs and investigated whether TUDCA treatment would be able to increase EV production efficiency and tissue regenerative capacity of EVs. Indeed, it appears that TUDCA priming to MSC increases the yield of MSC-EVs >2 times by reducing the cellular cholesterol level in MSCs and increasing the exocytosis-related CAV1 expression. Interestingly, it was found that the EVs derived from TUDCA-primed MSCs (T-EV) contained higher amounts of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL1RN, IL6, IL10, and IL11) and osteogenic proteins (ALP, RUNX2, BMP2, BMPR1, and BMPR2) than those in control MSC-EVs (C-EV). Besides, it was shown that T-EV not only regulated M1/M2 macrophages differentiation of monocytes, also effectively increased the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs as well as bone tissue regeneration in a bone defect rat model. Based on these results, it is concluded that TUDCA treatment to MSC as a new approach endows EV with high-yield production and functionality. Thus, we strongly believe T-EV would be a powerful therapeutic material for bone tissue regeneration and potentially could be expanded to other types of tissue regeneration for clinical applications.","2023-02","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:11","45-56","","","354","","J.

However, the secretomes in MSC-CM that act as active ingredients for bone regeneration, as well as their mechanisms, remains unclear. Exosomes, components of MSC-CM, provide the recipient cells with genetic information and enhance the recipient cellular paracrine stimulation, which contributes to tissue regeneration. We hypothesized that MSC-CM-derived exosomes (MSC-Exo) promoted bone regeneration, and that angiogenesis was a key step. Here, we prepared an MSC-Exo group, MSC-CM group, and Exo-antiVEGF group (MSC-Exo with angiogenesis inhibitor), and examined the osteogenic and angiogenic potential in MSCs. Furthermore, we used a rat model of calvaria bone defect and implanted each sample to evaluate bone formation weekly, until week 4 after treatment. Results showed that MSC-Exo enhanced cellular migration and osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression in MSCs compared to that in other groups. In vivo, early bone formation by MSC-Exo was also confirmed. Two weeks after implantation, the newly formed bone area was 31.5 +/- 6.5% in the MSC-Exo group while those in the control and Exo-antiVEGF groups were 15.4 +/- 4.4% and 8.7 +/- 1.1%, respectively. Four weeks after implantation, differences in the area between the MSC-Exo group and the Exo-antiVEGF or control groups were further broadened. Histologically, notable accumulation of osteoblast-like cells and vascular endothelial cells was observed in the MSC-Exo group; however, fewer cells were found in the Exo-antiVEGF and control groups. In conclusion, MSC-Exo promoted bone regeneration during early stages, as well as enhanced angiogenesis. Considering the tissue regeneration with transplanted cells and their secretomes, this study suggests that exosomes might play an important role, especially in angiogenesis.","2019-11-21","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:11","e0225472","","11","14","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 19 Place: San Francisco Publisher: Public Library Science Web of Science ID: WOS:000533886900069","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\U2DQ7DH8\Takeuchi et al. - 2019 - Exosomes from conditioned media of bone marrow-der.pdf","","","EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; MICE; SECRETOMES; STROMAL CELLS; TISSUE; VEGF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although MSCs have been recently known to respond to the mechanical microenvironment and thus orchestrate their behaviors and functions, the effects of such a biophysical cue on the paracrine pathway of MSCs, especially on the regulation of characteristics and bioactivity of MSC-derived exosomes have rarely been reported. In this study, we used periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs), which were cultured in the three-dimensional(3D) microscale magnetically stretched collagen hydrogels, as the model MSCs to explore the changes in characteristics (e.g., morphology, size distribution, typical surface protein expression, miRNA content, and internalization) and bioactivity of MSC-derived exosomes in response to matrix strain. We found that the levels of 25 miRNAs in exosomes secreted by PDLSCs in the 3D strain microenvironment (SM-Exo) were dramatically different from those obtained from the 3D culture microenvironment (Exo). Next, the bioactivity of SM-Exo was significantly enhanced as reflected by the improved proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of target cells (e.g., BMSCs). This was further confirmed by in vivo studies, in which PDLSC-derived exosomes obtained from the 3D strain microenvironment showed stronger bioactivity to repair alveolar bone defects in SD rats. This study proposed a novel strategy to promote alveolar bone regeneration via altered PDLSC-derived exosomes in the 3D strain microenvironment, and such an engineered mechanical microenvironment would be an effective tool in other regenerative studies and clinical applications.","2021-08-01","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:11","128040","","","417","","Chem.

Accumulating evidence supports the role of exosomes secreted by endothelial progenitor cells (EPC-Exos) in stimulating angiogenesis, which is closely coupled with osteogenesis. This study aimed to investigate whether EPC-Exos promote bone regeneration during DO in rats.MethodsExosomes were isolated from the supernatants of rat bone marrow EPCs via ultracentrifugation and characterized via transmission electron microscopy, tunable resistive pulse sensing analysis, and western blot analysis. Unilateral tibial DO models were generated using 68 Sprague-Dawley rats with a distraction rate of 0.5mm per day for 10days. After local injection of EPC-Exos into the distraction gaps after distraction, the therapeutic effects of EPC-Exos on bone regeneration and angiogenesis were assessed via X-ray, micro-computed tomography(micro-CT), and biomechanical and histological analyses. Pro-angiogenic effects and the potential mechanism underlying the effects of EPC-Exos on human umbilical vein endothelial cells were subsequently evaluated via in vitro assays including Cell Counting Kit-8, wound healing, tube formation, and western blot assays.ResultsEPC-Exos were spherical or cup-shaped vesicles ranging from 50 to 150nm in diameter and expressed markers including CD9, Alix, and TSG101. X-ray, micro-CT, and histological analyses revealed that bone regeneration was markedly accelerated in rats treated with EPC-Exos. The distracted tibias from the Exos group also displayed enhanced mechanical properties. Moreover, vessel density was higher in the Exos group than in the control group. In addition, in vitro analyses revealed that EPC-Exos enhanced the proliferation, migration, and angiogenic capacity of endothelial cells in an miR-126-dependent manner. Further, EPC-Exos downregulated SPRED1 and activated Raf/ERK signaling.ConclusionsThe present results show that EPC-Exos accelerate bone regeneration during DO by stimulating angiogenesis, suggesting their use as a novel method to shorten the treatment duration of DO.","2019-01-11","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:11","12","","","10","","Stem Cell Res.

The success of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based research strategies in improving bone regeneration was hampered not only due to the limited knowledge of therapeutic actions of MSCs but also due to difficulties as well as expenses related to cell manufacturing and time taken for ethical approvals for clinical use of living cells and engineered tissues. The recent trend indicated that there is a shift from the direct usage of MSCs toward the application of paracrine factors and extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from their MSC secretome in bone tissue regeneration. This shift has directed research into the development of ""cell-free"" therapeutics, which could be a better alternative due to its several advantages over the use of their parental MSCs. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggested that the 3D microenvironment influences the paracrine effects of MSCs. Although the osteogenic role of EVs has been explored recently, the current study showed, for the first time, that encapsulation of EVs along with MC3T3 cells in a 3D hydrogel-assisted culture with a distinct porous microenvironment having meso and macro (0.05-200 mu m) pore size distribution resulted in an improved osteogenic response in vitro. The present work was primarily focused on investigating the influence of EVs isolated under distinct priming conditions to enhance the osteogenic potential. In addition, in the current work, the osteogenic ability of different types of EVs (microvesicles and exosomes) and total EVs isolated at different time points was also examined when encapsulated with MC3T3 cells in an alginate gel. Using various biochemical assays, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) production and calcium secretion, it was observed that both microvesicles and exosomes collected from MC3T3 cells independently had osteogenic potential; however, their collective activity was found to be superior. We further showed that EVs induce an early osteogenic response in MC3T3 cells as indicated by ALP and calcium secretion at a much earlier time point, compared to the controls. Our data suggested that this 3D hydrogel-assisted system provides close proximity of cells and EVs, and thus, mimics the in vivo scenario, making it clinically useful for bone tissue engineering.","2021-06-14","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:11","2687-2700","","6","7","","ACS Biomater.

Exosomes have been demonstrated to facilitate bone regeneration through enhanced osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Moreover, functional stimulation to mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) was reported to further boost the pro-angiogenic ability of exosomes secreted. However, whether the stimulation by bioactive trace elements of biomaterials could enhance pro-angiogenic capability of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs)-derived exosomes and consequently promote in vivo vascularized bone regeneration has not been investigated. In this study, strontium-substituted calcium silicate (Sr-CS) was chosen and the biological function of BMSCs-derived exosomes after Sr-CS stimulation (Sr-CSExo) was systemically investigated. The results showed that Sr-CS-Exo could significantly promote in vitro angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which might be attributed to elevated pro-angiogenic miR-146a cargos and inhibition of Smad4 and NF2 proteins. Moreover, the in vivo study confirmed that Sr-CS-Exo possessed superior pro-angiogenic ability, which contributed to the accelerated developmental vascularization in zebrafish along with the neovascularization and bone regeneration in rat distal femur defects. Our findings may provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying Sr containing biomaterials-induced angiogenesis, and for the first time, proposed that Sr-CS-Exo may serve as the candidate engineered-exosomes with dual-functional regulation for angiogenesis and osteogenesis in vascularized bone regeneration.

Adipose stem cells (ADSCs) and exosomes were combined with the scaffold material in the current work to effectively create a hydroxyapatite (HA) coated porous titanium alloy scaffold that can load ADSCs and release exosomes over time. The composite made up for the drawbacks of traditional titanium alloy materials with higher mechanical characteristics and a quicker rate of osseointegration. Exosomes (Exos) are capable of promoting the development of ADSCs in porous titanium alloy scaffolds with HA coating, based on experimental findings from in vitro and in vivo research. Additionally, compared to pure Ti implants, the HA scaffolds loaded with adipose stem cell exosomes demonstrated improved bone regeneration capability and bone integration ability. It offers a theoretical foundation for the combined use of stem cell treatment and bone tissue engineering, as well as a design concept for the creation and use of novel clinical bone defect repair materials.","2023-10-31","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:12","1283811","","","11","","Front.

Meanwhile, macrophages influence the osteogenesis of BMSCs through paracrine forms such as exosomes. We focused on whether exosomes of macrophages promote osteogenic differentiation. The results indicated that M1 and M2 polarized macrophage exosomes all can promote osteogenesis of BMSCs. Especially, M1 macrophage-derived exosomes promote osteogenesis of BMSCs through microRNA-21a-5p at the early stage of inflammation.

Further, MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are established vehicles of paracrine factors, supporting inter-cellular communication between MSC and other interacting cell types, such as monocytes/macrophages. However, the information about the immunomodulatory potential of EVs derived from MSC and biomaterial constructs (MSC + BCP:EV) and inflammatory primed constructs (MSCp + BCP:EV) are scarce. Hence, we isolated and characterized EVs from these different systems, and compared their cytokine contents with plastic-adherent MSC-derived EVs (MSC:EV). When EVs from all three MSC systems were added to the primary blood-derived macrophages in vitro, significantly higher numbers of M0 (naive) macrophages shifted to M2-like (anti-inflammatory) by MSCp + BCP:EV treatment. Further, this treatment led to enhanced switching of M1 polarized macrophages to M2 polarized, and conversely, M2 to M1, as evaluated by determining the M1/M2 ratios after treatment. The enhanced macrophage modulation by MSCp + BCP:EV was attributed to their higher immunomodulatory (TNF alpha, IL1 beta, IL5), angiogenic (VEGF), and chemokine-rich (RANTES, MCP1, MIP1 beta) cytokine cargo. In conclusion, we successfully isolated and characterized EVs from MSC + BCP constructs and demonstrated that, depending upon the tissue microenvironment, these EVs contribute towards modulating the macrophage-mediated inflammation and healing responses. The study offers new insights into the use of biomaterial-induced EVs for MSC secretome delivery, as a step towards future 'cell-free' bone regenerative therapies.","2022-02","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:12","470","","3","11","","Cells","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 22 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000754794200001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\DFT7A3ET\Rana et al. - 2022 - Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Primed Mesench.pdf","","","biomaterial; biphasic calcium phosphate; bone regeneration; CHROMATOGRAPHY; cytokines; extracellular vesicles or EV; immunomodulation; macrophage polarization; macrophages; mesenchymal stromal cells; monocytes; PHENOTYPE; REGENERATION; secretome; STEM-CELLS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A mineralized microenvironment, similar to the native bone microenvironment, is required in the scaffold to recruit and differentiate local mesenchymal stem cells at the bone defect site. Further, extracellular vesicles (EVs), pre-osteoblasts' secretome, contain osteoinductive cargo and have recently been exploited in bone regeneration. This work developed a cell-free and mechanically strong interpenetrating network-based scaffold for BTE by combining the action of osteoinductive EVs with a mineralized microenvironment. The MC3T3 (a pre-osteoblast cell line) is used as a source of EVs and as the target population. The optimal concentration of MC3T3-EVs was first determined to induce osteogenesis in target cells. The osteoinductive potential of the scaffold was estimated in vitro by osteogenesis-related markers like the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme and calcium content. The MC3T3-EVs cargo was also studied for osteoinductive signals such as ALP, calcium, and mRNA. The findings of this work indicated that MC3T3-EVs at a 90 mu g/mL dose had significantly higher ALP activity than 0 mu g/mL (1.47-fold), 10 mu g/mL (1.41-fold), and 30 mu g/mL (1.39-fold) EV-concentration on day 14. Further combination of the optimum dose of EVs with a mineralized microenvironment significantly enhanced ALP activity (1.5-fold) and mineralization (3.36-fold) as compared to the control group on day 7. EV cargo analysis revealed the presence of calcium, the ALP enzyme, and the mRNAs necessary for osteogenesis and angiogenesis. ALP activity was significantly boosted in the EV-containing target cells as early as day 1, and mineralization began on day 7 because MC3T3-EVs carry ALP enzymes and calcium as cargo. When osteoinductive EVs were combined with an osteoconductive mineralized microenvironment, osteogenesis was significantly enhanced in target cells at early time points. The interaction between osteoinductive EVs and the mineralized milieu facilitates the process of osteogenesis in the target cells and suggests a potential cell-free strategy for in vivo bone repair.","2023-09-06","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:12","","","","","","J.

However, insufficient number of cells and lack of regenerative properties during in vitro expansion still limit the clinical applicability of MSC therapies. Here, we demonstrated a preconditioning strategy with trophoblast stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (TSC-EVs) to boost the proliferation and regenerative capacity of MSCs. Methods We employed cell proliferation analyses such as CCK8 and BrdU assays to determine the proliferation-promoting role of TSC-EVs on MSCs. Osteogenic effects of TSC-EVs on MSCs were assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium assays, and calvarial bone defect animal models. For skin regenerative effects, skin wound mice model was exploited to analyze wound-healing rate in this study, as well as immunofluorescence and histological staining evaluates. We also performed the small RNA profiling and RNA-sequencing analyzes to understand the cellular mechanism of TSC-EVs on MSCs. Results TSC-EVs significantly promoted MSC proliferation under xeno-free conditions and facilitated the therapeutic effects of MSCs, including osteogenesis, anti-senescence, and wound healing. Transcriptomic analysis also provided evidence that specific microRNAs in TSC-EVs and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in TSC-EV-treated MSCs showed the possibility of TSC-EVs triggering the regenerative abilities of MSCs with cytokine interaction. Hence, we found that NGF/Akt signaling mediated the regenerative effects of TSC-EVs on MSCs as a particular cellular signaling pathway. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrated the functional properties of TSC-EVs on MSCs for MSC-based therapeutic applications, suggesting that TSC-EVs may serve as a potential preconditioning source for MSC therapy in the clinical field of regenerative medicine.","2023-06-27","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:13","62","","1","27","","Biomater.

The biological effects of exosomes largely depend on cellular origin and physiological status of donor cell. In the present study, we explored the influence of conditioned exosomes from SHED with osteogenic induction on periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) in vitro. Conditioned SHED-Exos from a 3-day osteogenic supernatant were applied during PDLSCs osteogenic differentiation. We found that conditioned SHED-Exos had no cytotoxicity on PDLSCs viability assessed by CCK-8 assay. These SHED-Exos promoted PDLSCs osteogenic differentiation with deep Alizarin red staining, high alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and upregulated osteogenic gene expression (RUNX2, OPN and OCN). We further found BMP/Smad signaling and Wnt/beta-catenin were activated by enhanced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and increased nuclear beta-catenin protein expression. Inhibiting these two signaling pathways with specific inhibitors (cardamonin and LDN193189) remarkably weakened the enhanced osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, Wnt3a and BMP2 were upregulated in SHED and SHED-Exos. Silencing Wnt3a and BMP2 in SHED-Exos partially counteracts the enhanced osteogenic differentiation. Our findings indicate that conditioned SHED-Exos-enhanced PDLSCs osteogenic differentiation was partly due to its carrying Wnt3a and BMP2. These data provide new insights into the use of SHED-Exos in periodontitis-induced bone defects therapy.","2020-02","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:13","1-11","","","111","","Differentiation","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 11 Place: Oxford Publisher: Elsevier Sci Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000503389000001","","","","","BETA-CATENIN; BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN-2; DENTAL-PULP; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; MARROW; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; NONCODING RNA; OSTEOBLASTIC DIFFERENTIATION; Osteogenic differentiation; PATHWAY; PDLSCs; PERIODONTAL REGENERATION; SHED-Exos; Wnt and BMP signaling pathways","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In bone remodeling, osteoclasts generate large amounts of sEVs. However, there is very few research studying whether and how osteoclast-derived sEVs (OC-sEVs) affect surrounding cells. In our study, microarray analysis identified miR-106a-5p as highly enriched in OC-sEV. Further experiments confirmed that OC-sEVs inhibited Fam134a through miR-106a-5p and significantly promoted bone mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) osteogenic mineralization in vitro. Next, we prepared an sEV-modified demineralized bone matrix (DBM) as scaffold treating calvarial defect mouse model to evaluate the pro-osteogenic activities of the scaffold. In vivo results indicated that DBM modified with miR-106a-5p-sEVs showed an enhanced capacity for bone regeneration. This important finding further emphasizes that sEV-mediated miR-106a-5p transfer plays a critical role in osteogenesis and indicates a novel communication mode between osteoclasts and BMSCs.","2023-02","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:13","110549","","","102","","Cell.

The use of in vitro coculture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) has been one of the most explored options. Both cell types secrete specific growth factors that are mutually beneficial, and studies suggested that cell-cell communication and paracrine secretion could be affected by a number of factors. However, little is known about the effect of cell patterning and the distance between cell populations on their crosstalk. In the present study, we showed that the separation and distance between ECs and MSCs populations affects angiogenesis by modulating cell-cell communication. HUVECs grown farther apart from MSCs ((>)400 pm) presented characteristics of an early stage of angiogenesis (migration/proliferation). Results showed an increase in the up regulation of VEGF, FGF-2, and ITGA3 (integrins) but a smaller fold change in the expression of VE-Cadherin and Ang-1. HUVECs were also still highly proliferative. On the contrary, HUVECs incubated closer (<= 200 mu m) to MSCs, showed signs of stabilization, mainly an increase in Ang-1 and VE-cadherin expression, as well as tighter monolayers. Conditioned media collected from HUVECs and MSCs grown <= 200 mu m apart preferentially promoted tube formation, a later stage of angiogenesis, due in part to a significant increase in Ang-1 paracrine secretion. In addition, in groups in which fibers were printed farther apart (400 mu m), cells produced EVs with a significantly increase cargo. Finally, in vivo experiment results showed an increase in blood vessels density and new bone thickness after 12 weeks of implantation in rat cranial defect, further suggesting the higher efficiency of indirect ECs/MSCs contact in prompting the release of paracrine signals that stimulate the angiogenesis of local tissues, and enhanced subsequent bone regeneration.","2019-11","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:13","119423","","","222","","Biomaterials","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 12 Place: Oxford Publisher: Elsevier Sci Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000488138700003","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\7IT4D5VN\Piard et al. - 2019 - 3D printed HUVECsMSCs cocultures impact cellular .pdf","","","3D printing; Angiogenesis; AUTOCRINE; Bone tissue engineering; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; EVs; EXOSOMES; IN-VITRO; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; OXYGEN GRADIENTS; Paracrine signaling; REGENERATION; SCAFFOLDS; VASCULARIZATION; VIABILITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to find the synergic effects of decellularized bone (DB) ECM and ECVs on the repair of rabbit. Methods The quality of decellularized sheep bones was confirmed by H&E, Hoechst, DNA quantification, immunohistochemistry, histochemical staining, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Osteoblast-derived ECVs were evaluated by internalization test, Transmission electron microscopy, Dynamic light scattering, and flow cytometry for CD9, CD63, CD81 markers. The hydrogel containing DB and hydroxyapatite (HA) with or without ECVs was evaluated for osteoblast functions and bone repair both in vitro and in vivo. Results The data indicated ECM preservation after decellularization as well as cell depletion. In vitro assessments revealed that mineralization and alkaline phosphatase activity did not improve after treatment of MG63 cells by ECVs, while in vivo morphomatrical estimations showed synergic effects of ECVs and DB + HA hydrogels on increasing the number of bone-specific cells and vessel and bone area compared to the control, DB + HA and ECV-treated groups.

The study was performed by synchrotron radiation-based high-resolution tomography, focusing on the analysis of bone mass density distribution (BMDD). We showed the appropriateness of the proposed method to sensitively measure BMDD in bone-regenerated tissues; indeed, the same method was previously applied only in the evaluation of diagnosis and treatment of bone diseases. In this context, the scientific interest of this study is related to the use of oral stem cells, their engineered and not engineered derivatives, in the regeneration of the skeletal segment. Abstract Tissue engineering has been shown to offer promising approaches for bone regeneration, mostly based on replacement with biomaterials that provide specific environments and support for bone growth. In this context, we previously showed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their derivatives, such as conditioned medium (CM) and extracellular vesicles (EV), when seeded on collagen membranes (COL) or polylactide (PLA) biomaterials, are able to favor bone tissue regeneration, especially evidenced in animal model calvary defects. In the present study, we investigated whether the enrichment of a rat calvary defect site with CM, EVs and polyethylenimine (PEI)-engineered EVs could substantially modify the bone remodeling kinetics during defect healing, as these products were reported to favor bone regeneration. In particular, we focused the study, performed by synchrotron radiation-based high-resolution tomography, on the analysis of the bone mass density distribution. We proved that the enrichment of a defect site with CM, EVs and PEI-EVs substantially modifies, often accelerating, bone remodeling kinetics and the related mineralization process during defect healing. Moreover, different biomaterials (COL or PLA) in combination with stem cells of different origin (namely, human periodontal ligament stem cells-hPDLSCs and human gingival mesenchymal stem cells-hGMSCs) and their own CM, EVs and PEI-EVs products were shown to exhibit different mineralization kinetics.","2020-04","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:13","2336","","7","10","","Appl.

However, limited bioactivity affects their performance. Therefore, bioactive molecules and cells are often added to enhance their performance. Exosomes have emerged as cell-secreted vesicles, delivering proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids in a paracrine/endocrine fashion. We studied two complementary aspects required for exosome activity/therapy using purified exosomes: first, the intracellular uptake of labeled exosomes and second, the influence of delivered exosomes on cell behavior. Origin-specific differences in the characteristics of purified exosomes, quantification of time-dependent intracellular uptake of PKH-26-labeled exosomes by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and preosteoblasts, and influence on cell behavior were evaluated. Furthermore, exosomes from osteoblasts and MSCs cultured under normal and osteogenic environments were isolated. There is little data available on the concentration and dose of exosomes required for bone regeneration. Therefore, equal amounts of quantified exosomes were implanted in vivo in rat tibia critical defects using a calcium sulfate-nano-hydroxyapatite nanocement (NC) bone filler as the carrier. Bone regeneration was quantified using micro-computed tomography and histology. Along with inducing early maturation and mineral deposition by primary preosteoblasts in vitro, exosome treatment also demonstrated a positive effect on bone mineralization in vivo. Our study concludes that providing a local delivery of exosomes loaded onto a slowly resorbing NC bone filler can provide a potential alternate to autografts as a bone substitute.","2021-04-19","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:13","3716-3726","","4","4","","ACS Appl.

Here, we investigated the benefits and underlying mechanism of exosomes secreted via stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED-derived exosomes) in promoting alveolar bone regeneration, thus providing new insights into exosome-based therapy for periodontitis. SHED-derived exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation. The impacts of SHED-derived exosomes on the angiogenic ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the osteogenic capability of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were evaluated in vitro. Compound C, a pharmacological blocker of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), was used to examine the role of the AMPK signaling cascade in these processes. Periodontal defect rat models were established and treated with PBS, beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP), or a grouping of exosomes/beta-TCP. Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) scanning, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, Masson staining, and immunofluorescence staining were done to inspect the impacts of the exosomes/beta-TCP combination on periodontal bone regeneration. Our outcomes indicated that the expression of angiogenesis-related genes (KDR, SDF-1, and FGF2), osteogenesis-related genes (COLT, RUNX2, and OPN), and phosphorylated (p)-AMPK were upregulated after treatment with exosomes, while the positive impacts of SHED-derived exosomes on HUVECs and BMSCs were partially reversed by compound C. Micro-CT analysis demonstrated that the exosomes/beta-TCP group exhibited better bone regeneration than either the beta-TCP group or the control group. Additionally, the results of HE and Masson staining as well as immunofluorescence staining showed neovascularization and new bone formation in the exosomes/beta-TCP group but only limited new bone formation in the other two groups. Thus, SHED-derived exosomes contribute to periodontal bone regeneration by promoting neovascularization and new bone formation, possibly through the AMPK signaling pathway.","2019-07","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:13","3561-3571","","7","5","","ACS Biomater.

While beneficial, from a translational perspective, extracellular vesicles with consistent functionality and target specificity are required to achieve the goals of precision medicine and tissue engineering. Prior research has identified that the miRNA composition of mesenchymal stem cell derived extracellular vesicles contributes significantly towards extracellular vesicles functionality. In this study, we hypothesized that mesenchymal stem cell derived extracellular vesicle functionality can be rendered pathway-specific using a miRNA-based extracellular vesicles engineering approach. To test this hypothesis, we utilized bone repair as a model system and the BMP2 signaling cascade as the targeted pathway. We engineered mesenchymal stem cell extracellular vesicles to possess increased levels of miR-424, a potentiator of the BMP2 signaling cascade. We evaluated the physical and functional characteristics of these extracellular vesicles and their enhanced ability to trigger the osteogenic differentiation of naive mesenchymal stem cell in vitro and facilitate bone repair in vivo. Results indicated that the engineered extracellular vesicles retained their extracellular vesicles characteristics and endocytic functionality and demonstrated enhanced osteoinductive function by activating SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and mesenchymal stem cell differentiation in vitro and enhanced bone repair in vivo. Furthermore, the inherent immunomodulatory properties of the mesenchymal stem cell derived extracellular vesicles remained unaltered. These results serve as a proof-of-concept for miRNA-based extracellular vesicles engineering approaches for regenerative medicine applications.","2023-02-08","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:13","1127594","","","11","","Front.

Clinically, growth factors such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) are used to enhance/hasten this process to heal critical sized defects. However, the clinical application of such growth factors is fraught with dosage challenges as well as immunological and ectopic complications. The identification of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as active components of the MSC secretome suggest alternative approaches to enhancing bone regeneration. Based on our earlier studies on the properties of EVs from lineage specified MSCs, this study sought to engineer EVs to enhance osteogenic differentiation. To generate MSC EVs with enhanced osteoinductive abilities, genetically modified human bone marrow derived MSCs (HMSCs) were generated by constitutively expressing BMP2. We hypothesized that these cells would generate functionally engineered EVs (FEEs) with enhanced osteoinductive properties. Our results show that these FEEs maintained the general physical and biochemical characteristics of naive HMSC EVs in the form of size distribution, EV marker expression and endocytic properties but show increased bone regenerative potential compared to MSC EVs in a rat calvarial defect model in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that although BMP2 was constitutively expressed in the parental cells, the corresponding EVs (FEEs) do not contain BMP2 protein as an EV constituent. Further investigations revealed that the FEEs potentiate the BMP2 signaling cascade possibly due to an altered miRNA composition. Collectively, these studies indicate that EVs' functionality may be engineered by genetic modification of the parental MSCs to induce osteoinduction and bone regeneration. Significance statement With mounting evidence for the potential of MSC EVs in treatment of diseases and regeneration of tissues, it is imperative to evaluate if they can be modified for application specificity. The results presented here indicate the possibility for generating Functionally Engineered EVs (FEEs) from MSC sources. As a proof of concept approach, we have shown that EVs derived from genetically modified MSCs (BMP2 over-expression) can be effective as biomimetic substitutes for growth factors for enhanced tissue-specific regeneration (bone regeneration) in vivo. Mechanistic studies highlight the role of EV miRNAs in inducing pathway-specific changes. We believe that this study will be useful to researchers evaluating EVs for regenerative medicine applications. (C) 2020 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Bone-secreted exosomes play important roles in bone homeostasis, the interruption of which can lead to diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteopetrosis. Though the relationship between vascular and bone homeostasis has been recognized recently, the role of vascular endothelial cell (EC)-secreted exosomes (EC-Exos) in bone homeostasis is not well understood. Herein, we found that EC-Exos show more efficient bone targeting than osteoblast-derived exosomes or bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes. We also found that EC-Exos can be internalized by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) to alter their morphology. EC-Exos can inhibit osteoclast activity in vitro and inhibit osteoporosis in an ovariectomized mouse model. Sequencing of exosome miRNA revealed that miR-155 was highly expressed in EC-Exos-treated BMMs. The miR-155 level in EC-Exos was much higher than that in BMMs and ECs, indicating that miR-155 was endogenous cargo of EC-derived vesicles. Blockage of BMMs miR-155 levels reversed the suppression by EC-Exos of osteoclast induction, confirming that exosomal miR-155 may have therapeutic potential against osteoporosis. Taken together, our findings suggest that EC-Exos may be utilized as a bone targeting and nontoxic nanomedicine for the treatment of bone resorption disorders.","2019-05","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:14","3040-3048","","5","19","","Nano Lett.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 9 Place: Washington Publisher: Amer Chemical Soc Web of Science ID: WOS:000467781900035","","","","","ANGIOGENESIS; BIOGENESIS; bone targeting; DIFFERENTIATION; Exosomes; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; MICRORNA-155; miR-155; nanomedicine; OSTEOGENESIS; osteoporosis; PREVENTION; PROGENITORS; VASCULARIZATION; VESSEL FORMATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How different loading intensities alter the biological effect of these vesicles is not fully understood. Dynamic fluid shear stress at low intensity (0.7 +/- 0.3 Pa, 5 Hz) or high intensity (2.9 +/- 0.2 Pa, 1 Hz) was used on mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells for 2 min in the presence or absence of chemical compounds that inhibit release or biogenesis of extracellular vesicles. We used a Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Beta ligand-induced osteoclastogenesis assay to evaluate the biological effect of different fractions of extracellular vesicles obtained through centrifugation of medium from hematopoietic stem cells. Osteoclast formation was reduced by microvesicles (10 000x g) obtained after low-intensity loading and induced by exosomes (100 000x g) obtained after high-intensity loading. These osteoclast-modulating effects could be diminished or eliminated by depletion of extracellular vesicles from the conditioned medium, inhibition of general extracellular vesicle release, inhibition of microvesicle biogenesis (low intensity), inhibition of ESCRT-independent exosome biogenesis (high intensity), as well as by inhibition of dynamin-dependent vesicle uptake in osteoclast progenitor cells. Taken together, the intensity of mechanical loading affects the release of extracellular vesicles and change their osteoclast-modulating effect. The intensity of mechanical loading strongly affects bone remodeling by either formation of bone or resorption of bone.

The results demonstrated that EVs of adipose-derived MSCs showed the most efficiency. Meanwhile, protein proteomics revealed the potential mechanisms. We provide a novel evidence that the adipose is a superior reservoir in EV-based nanotechnologies and biomaterials for cartilage and bone regeneration. Direct implantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cartilage and bone tissue engineering faces challenges, such as immune rejection and loss of cellular viability or functionality. As nanoscale natural particles, exosomes or small extracellular vesicles (EVs) of MSCs have potential to circumvent these problems. It is significant to investigate the impact of the tissue origin of MSCs on the therapeutic bioactivity of their corresponding EVs for cartilage and bone regeneration. Here, rat MSCs isolated from the adipose, bone marrow, and synovium are cultured to obtain their corresponding EVs (ADSC-EVs, BMSCEVs, and SMSC-EVs, respectively). The ADSC-EVs stimulate the migration, proliferation, and chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro as well as cartilage and bone regeneration in a mouse model more than the BMSC-EVs or SMSC-EVs. Proteomics analysis reveals that the tissue origin contributes to the distinct protein profiles among the three types of EVs, which induced cartilage and bone regenerative capacities by potential mechanisms of regulating signaling pathways including focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, actin cytoskeleton, cAMP, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Consequently, these findings provide insight that the adipose may be a superior candidate in EV-based nanomedicine for cartilage and bone regeneration.

However, the outcome of their use on alveolar bone loss has not yet been demonstrated.Methods and resultsThis study evaluates the effect of oral administration of MEVs on ovariectomized (OVX) mice. There is a reduced height of the alveolar bone crest in OVX mice by MEVs treatment, but the alveolar bone parameters are not altered. OVX mice are then submitted to a force-induced bone remodeling model by orthodontic tooth movement (OTM). MEVs-treated mice have markedly less bone remodeling movement, unlike the untreated OVX mice. Also, OVX mice treated with MEVs show an increased number of osteoblasts and osteocytes associated with higher sclerostin expression and reduce osteoclasts in the alveolar bone. Although the treatment with MEVs in OVX mice does not show differences in root structure in OTM, few odontoclasts are observed in the dental roots of OVX-treated mice. Compared to untreated mice, maxillary and systemic RANKL/OPG ratios are reduced in OVX mice treated with MEVs.ConclusionTreatment with MEVs results in positive bone cell balance in the alveolar bone and dental roots, indicating its beneficial potential in treating alveolar bone loss in the nutritional context. Bovine milk extracellular vesicles treat mice ovariectomized and submit to the orthodontic tooth movement model, preserving alveolar bone crest and dental roots and protecting against force-induced bone and root resorption.

Exosomes secreted from AB-BMSCs pre-differentiated for 0 and 7 days were cocultured with BMSCs in vitro to investigate their effect on the differentiation of the BMSCs. MiRNAs from AB-BMSCs at different stages of osteogenic differentiation were analyzed. BMSCs seeded on poly-Llactic acid(PLLA) scaffolds were treated with miRNA antagonist-decorated exosomes to verify their effect on new bone regeneration. Exosomes pre-differentiated for 7 days effectively promoted the differentiation of BMSCs. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that miRNAs within the exosomes were differentially expressed, including the upregulation of osteogenic miRNAs (miR-3182, miR-1468) and downregulation of anti-osteogenic miRNAs (miR182-5p, miR-335-3p, miR-382-5p), causing activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The treatment of BMSC-seeded scaffolds with anti-miR-182-5p decorated exosomes demonstrated enhanced osteogenic differentiation and efficient formation of new bone. In conclusion, Osteogenic exosomes secreted from pre-differentiated AB-BMSCs were identified and the gene modification of exosomes provides great potential as a bone regeneration strategy.","2023-06","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:14","106798","","","192","","Pharmacol.

Several lines of evidence demonstrate that macrophages contribute to the immunological regulation of MSC and osteoblast function during bone regeneration. Recent studies demonstrate that macrophage polarization influences this regulatory process. In this manuscript, we investigated the paracrine functional role of naive (M0), M1 and M2 polarized macrophage derived EVs in bone repair. Treatment of rat calvaria defects with no EVs, M0 EVs, M1 EVs, or M2 EVs revealed polarization-specific control of bone regeneration by macrophage EVs at 3 and 6 weeks. M0 and M2 EVs promoted repair/regeneration and M1 EVs inhibited bone repair. Pathway-specific studies conducted in cell culture showed that M1 EVs negatively regulated the BMP signaling pathway, specifically BMP2 and BMP9. In parallel, miRNA sequencing studies showed similar miRNA cargo in M0 and M2 EVs and different miRNA cargo in M1 EVs. Functional examination of M1 macrophage EV-enriched miR-155 demonstrated that miR-155 mimic treatment reduced MSC osteogenic differentiation as measured by reduced BMP2, BMP9 and RUNX2 expression when compared to controls. Conversely, treatment of MSCs with the M2 macrophage EV-enriched miR-378a mimic increased MSC osteoinductive gene expression when compared to controls. These functional studies implicate polarized macrophage EV miRNAs in the positive or negative regulation of bone regeneration that was observed in vivo. Overall, the results presented in this study indicate that macrophage polarization influences EV cargo and related EV function in the paracrine regulation of bone regeneration.","2020-12","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:14","115627","","","141","","Bone","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 12 Place: New York Publisher: Elsevier Science Inc Web of Science ID: WOS:000601334700009","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\9MMMA95N\Kang et al. - 2020 - Bone regeneration is mediated by macrophage extrac.pdf","","","Bone repair; DIFFERENTIATION; Exosomes; EXOSOMES; Extracellular vesicles; Macrophages; MESENCHYMAL-STEM-CELLS; Monocytes; OSTEOGENESIS; OSTEOMACS; TOOLS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although therapeutic interventions for bone regeneration exist, their effectiveness is questioned, especially under certain circumstances, such as critical size defects. This gap of curative options has led to the search for new and more effective therapeutic approaches for bone regeneration; among them, the possibility of using extracellular vesicles (EVs) is gaining ground. EVs are secreted, biocompatible, nano-sized vesicles that play a pivotal role as messengers between donor and target cells, mediated by their specific cargo. Evidence shows that bone-relevant cells secrete osteoanabolic EVs, whose functionality can be further improved by several strategies. This, together with the low immunogenicity of EVs and their storage advantages, make them attractive candidates for clinical prospects in bone regeneration. However, before EVs reach clinical translation, a number of concerns should be addressed. Unraveling the EVs' mode of action in bone regeneration is one of them; the molecular mediators driving their osteoanabolic effects in acceptor cells are now beginning to be uncovered. Increasing the functional and bone targeting abilities of EVs are also matters of intense research. Here, we summarize the cell sources offering osteoanabolic EVs, and the current knowledge about the molecular cargos that mediate bone regeneration. Moreover, we discuss strategies under development to improve the osteoanabolic and bone-targeting potential of EVs.","2022-02","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:14","1865","","3","23","","Int.

In particular, collagen membranes possess ideal biological properties and can support infiltration and proliferation of osteoblasts, promoting bone regeneration. Our study aimed to develop a new biocompatible osteogenic construct composed of a commercially available collagen membrane (Evolution [Evo]), human periodontal-ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) enriched with extracellular vesicles (EVs), or polyethylenimine (PEI)-engineered EVs (PEI-EVs). Methods: Osteogenic ability and expression of osteogenic genes were evaluated in vitro in hPDLSCs cultured with or without Evo, with Evo and EVs, or PEI-EVs. In addition, the bone-regeneration capacity of Evo, Evo enriched with hPDLSCs, Evo enriched with hPDLSCs and EVs/PEI-EVs was investigated in rats subjected to calvarial defects. Results: Our results showed that Evo enriched with EVs and PEI-EVs showed high biocompatibility and osteogenic properties in vitro and in vivo. In addition, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction demonstrated the upregulation of osteogenic genes, such as TGFB1, MMP8, TUFT1, TFIP11, BMP2, and BMP4, in the presence of PEI-EVs. Upregulation of BMP2/4 was confirmed for Evo enriched with PEI-EVs and hPDLSCs both in vitro by Western blot and in vivo by immunofluorescence. Conclusion: Our results indicated that Evo enriched with hPDLSCs and PEI-EVs is able to promote a bone-regeneration process for the treatment of calvarium and ossification defects caused by accidental or surgery trauma. In particular, PEI-EVs had a significant role in activation of the osteogenic process.","2018","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:15","3805-3825","","","13","","Int. J.

In this regard, the MSC's immunomodulatory properties in tissue repair are well documented. The paracrine effects of MSCs in immunomodulation are, in part, attributable to their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs). When MSCs migrate to the wound bed, they are exposed to a myriad of inflammatory signals. To understand their response to an inflammatory environment from an EV perspective, we sought to evaluate the effects of the inflammatory cytokine TNF alpha on MSC EV mediated immunomodulation. Our results indicate that while the physical characteristics of the EVs remain unchanged, the TNF alpha preconditioned MSC EVs possess enhanced immunomodulatory properties. In vitro experiments using polarized (M1 and M2) primary mouse macrophages indicated that the preconditioned MSC EVs suppressed pro-inflammatory (M1) markers such as IL-1 beta and iNOS and elevated reparatory (M2) markers such as Arg1 and CD206. When evaluated in vivo in a rat calvarial defect model, the TNF alpha preconditioned MSC EVs reduced inflammation at 1-, 3- and 7-days post wounding resulting in the subsequent enhanced bone formation at 4- and 8-weeks post wounding possibly by modulation of oncostatin M (OSM) expression. An analysis of EV miRNA composition revealed significant changes to anti-inflammatory miRNAs in the preconditioned MSC EVs hinting at a possible role for EV derived miRNA in the enhanced immunomodulatory activity. Overall, these results indicate that MSC exposure to inflammatory signals influence the MSC EV's immunomodulatory function in the context of tissue repair. The specific function of TNF alpha preconditioned MSC EV miRNAs in immunomodulatory control of bone regeneration merits further investigation.","2022-05-02","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:15","878194","","","13","","Front.

Unlike bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs) cultured in vitro with normoxia, bone marrow in vivo is exposed to a hypoxic environment. To date, it remains unclear whether hypoxia preconditioning can improve the function of BMSC-derived EVs and be more conducive to bone repair. Herein, it is found that hypoxia preconditioned BMSCs secrete more biglycan (Bgn)-rich EVs via proteomics analysis, and these hypoxic EVs (Hypo-EVs) significantly promote osteoblast proliferation, migration, differentiation, and mineralization by activating the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway. Subsequently, an injectable bioactive hydrogel composed of poly(ethylene glycol)/polypeptide copolymers is developed to improve the stability and retention of Hypo-EVs in vivo. The Hypo-EVs-laden hydrogel shows continuous liberation of Hypo-EVs for 3 weeks and substantially accelerates bone regeneration in 5-mm rat cranial defects. Finally, it is confirmed that Bgn in EVs is a pivotal protein regulating osteoblast differentiation and mineralization and exerts its effects through paracrine mechanisms. Therefore, this study shows that hypoxia stimulation is an effective approach to optimize the therapeutic effects of BMSC-derived EVs and that injectable hydrogel-based EVs delivery is a promising strategy for tissue regeneration.","2023-05","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:15","","","21","33","","Adv.

In a hitherto obscure process related to aging and disease, local plugs in the lacuno-canalicular network disrupt cellular communication and impede bone homeostasis. By utilizing a suite of high-resolution imaging and physics-based techniques, it is shown here that the local plugs develop by accumulation and fusion of calcified nanospherites in lacunae and canaliculi (micropetrosis). Two distinctive nanospherites phenotypes are found to originate from different osteocytic elements. A substantial deviation in the spherites' composition in comparison to mineralized bone further suggests a mineralization process unlike regular bone mineralization. Clearly, mineralization of osteocyte lacunae qualifies as a strong marker for degrading bone material quality in skeletal aging. The understanding of micropetrosis may guide future therapeutics toward preserving osteocyte viability to maintain mechanical competence and fracture resistance of bone in elderly individuals.","2017-01-18","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:15","1602215","","3","13","","Small","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 10 Place: Weinheim Publisher: Wiley-V C H Verlag Gmbh Web of Science ID: WOS:000396567600004","","","","","APOPTOTIC BODIES; CALCIUM; CORTICAL BONE; HYDROXYAPATITE; MAGNESIUM; MATRIX VESICLES; OSTEOCYTE NETWORK; TISSUE; TRABECULAR BONE; VASCULAR CALCIFICATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about whether osteoclast-derived sEVs affect surrounding cells. In this study, osteoclasts were generated by stimulating bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) with macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear actor kB ligand (RANKL). We performed microarray analysis of sEV-microRNAs (miRNAs)s secreted from osteoclast at different stages and identified four miRNAs that were highly expressed in mature osteoclast-derived sEVs. One of these miRNAs, miR-324, significantly induced osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro by targeting ARHGAP1, a negative regulator of osteogenic differentiation. We next fabricated an sEV-modified scaffold by coating decalcified bone matrix (DBM) with osteoclast-derived sEVs, and the pro-osteogenic regeneration activities of the sEV-modified scaffold were validated in a mouse calvarial defect model. Notably, miR-324-enriched sEV-modified scaffold showed the highest capacity on bone regeneration, whereas inhibition of miR-324 in sEVs abrogated these effects. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-324-contained sEVs released from mature osteoclast play an essential role in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation and potentially bridge the coupling between osteoclasts and MSCs.","2021-03-05","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:15","1191-1203","","","23","","Mol.

Epigenetic regulation through histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition has been shown to increase differentiation capacity. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential of augmenting osteoblast epigenetic functionality using the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of osteoblast-derived EVs for bone regeneration. TSA was found to substantially alter osteoblast epigenetic function through reduced HDAC activity and increased histone acetylation. Treatment with TSA also significantly enhanced osteoblast alkaline phosphatase activity (1.35-fold), collagen production (2.8-fold) and calcium deposition (1.55-fold) during osteogenic culture (P <= 0.001). EVs derived from TSA-treated osteoblasts (TSA-EVs) exhibited reduced particle size (1-05-fold) (P > 0.05), concentration (1.4-fold) (P > 0.05) and protein content (1.16-fold) (P <= 0.001) when compared to untreated EVs. TSA-EVs significantly enhanced the proliferation (1.13-fold) and migration (1.3-fold) of human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) when compared to untreated EVs (P <= 0.05). Moreover, TSA-EVs upregulated hBMSCs osteoblast-related gene and protein expression (ALP, Col1a, BSP1 and OCN) when compared to cells cultured with untreated EVs. Importantly, TSA-EVs elicited a time-dose dependent increase in hBMSCs extracellular matrix mineralisation. MicroRNA profiling revealed a set of differentially expressed microRNAs from TSA-EVs, which were osteogenic-related. Target prediction demonstrated these microRNAs were involved in regulating pathways such as 'endocytosis' and 'Wnt signalling pathway'. Moreover, proteomics analysis identified the enrichment of proteins involved in transcriptional regulation within TSA-EVs. Taken together, our findings suggest that altering osteoblasts' epigenome accelerates their mineralisation and promotes the osteoinductive potency of secreted EVs partly due to the delivery of pro-osteogenic microRNAs and transcriptional regulating proteins. As such, for the first time we demonstrate the potential to harness epigenetic regulation as a novel engineering approach to enhance EVs therapeutic efficacy for bone repair.","2021-07","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:16","e12118","","9","10","","J.

Ti6Al4V titanium scaffolds with different pore sizes (500 and 1000 mu m) and shapes (square and triangle) were fabricated by selective laser melting. A bone-mimetic nano-needle hydroxyapatite (nnHA) coating was then applied. EVs were procured from scaffold-cultured osteoblasts over 2 weeks and vesicle concentration was determined using the CD63 ELISA. Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) following treatment with primed EVs was evaluated by assessing alkaline phosphatase activity, collagen production and calcium deposition. Triangle pore scaffolds significantly increased osteoblast mineralisation (1.5-fold) when compared to square architectures (P <= 0.001). Interestingly, EV yield was also significantly enhanced on these higher permeability structures (P <= 0.001), in particular (2.2-fold) for the larger pore structures (1000 mu m). Furthermore osteoblast-derived EVs isolated from triangular pore scaffolds significantly increased hBMSCs mineralisation when compared to EVs acquired from square pore scaffolds (1.7-fold) and 2D culture (2.2-fold) (P <= 0.001). Coating with nnHA significantly improved osteoblast mineralisation (>2.6-fold) and EV production (4.5-fold) when compared to uncoated scaffolds (P <= 0.001). Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of harnessing bone-mimetic culture platforms to enhance the production of pro-regenerative EVs as an acellular tool for bone repair.","2021-10-26","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:16","757220","","","9","","Front.

Although EVs' potential for bone regeneration has been shown, issues associated with their therapeutic potency and short half-life in vivo hinders their clinical utility. Epigenetic reprogramming with the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) has been reported to promote the osteoinductive potency of osteoblast-derived EVs. Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels functionalised with the synthetic nanoclay laponite (LAP) have been shown to effectively bind, stabilise, and improve the retention of bioactive factors. This study investigated the potential of utilising a GelMA-LAP hydrogel to improve local retention and control delivery of epigenetically enhanced osteoblast-derived EVs as a novel bone repair strategy. LAP was found to elicit a dose-dependent increase in GelMA compressive modulus and shear-thinning properties. Incorporation of the nanoclay was also found to enhance shape fidelity when 3D printed compared to LAP-free gels. Interestingly, GelMA hydrogels containing LAP displayed increased mineralisation capacity (1.41-fold) (p <= 0.01) over 14 days. EV release kinetics from these nanocomposite systems were also strongly influenced by LAP concentration with significantly more vesicles being released from GelMA constructs as detected by a CD63 ELISA (p <= 0.001). EVs derived from TSA-treated osteoblasts (TSA-EVs) enhanced proliferation (1.09-fold), migration (1.83-fold), histone acetylation (1.32-fold) and mineralisation (1.87-fold) of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) when released from the GelMA-LAP hydrogel compared to the untreated EV gels (p <= 0.01). Importantly, the TSA-EV functionalised GelMA-LAP hydrogel significantly promoted encapsulated hBMSCs extracellular matrix collagen production (>= 1.3-fold) and mineralisation (>= 1.78-fold) in a dose-dependent manner compared to untreated EV constructs (p <= 0.001). Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potential of combining epigenetically enhanced osteoblast-derived EVs with a nanocomposite photocurable hydrogel to promote the therapeutic efficacy of acellular vesicle approaches for bone regeneration.","2022-01","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:16","832","","2","23","","Int.

There is a need to develop more efficient delivery strategies to improve localized therapeutic efficacy and minimize off-target adverse effects. Here, exosome mimetics (EMs) are reported for bone targeting involving the introduction of hydroxyapatite-binding moieties through bioorthogonal functionalization. Bone-binding ability of the engineered EMs is verified with hydroxyapatite-coated scaffolds and an ex vivo bone-binding assay. The EM-bound construct provided a biocompatible substrate for cell adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. Particularly, the incorporation of Smoothened agonist (SAG) into EMs greatly increased the osteogenic capacity through the activation of hedgehog signaling. Furthermore, the scaffold integrated with EM/SAG significantly improved in vivo reossification. Lastly, biodistribution studies confirmed the accumulation of systemically administered EMs in bone tissue.

While they have a defined therapeutic potential, the spatial and temporal control of their activity in vivo remains a challenge. The objective of this study was to devise a methodology to encapsulate EVs in 3D hydrogels for prolonged delivery. To achieve this, we have leveraged the MSC EV interactions with ECM proteins and their derivative peptides. Using osteoinductive functionally engineered EVs (FEEs) derived from MSCs, we show that FEEs bind to mimetic peptides from collagen (DGEA, GFPGER) and fibronectin (RGD). In in vitro experiments, photocrosslinkable alginate hydrogels containing RGD were able to encapsulate, tether and retain the FEEs over a period of 7 days while maintaining the structural integrity and osteoinductive functionality of the EVs. When employed in a calvarial defect model in vivo , alginate-RGD hydrogels containing the FEEs enhanced bone regeneration by a factor of 4 compared to controls lacking FEEs and by a factor of 2 compared to controls lacking the tethering peptide. These results show that EVs can be tethered to biomaterials to promote bone repair and the importance of prolonged delivery in vivo . Results also provide a prelude to the possible use of this technology for controlled delivery of EVs for other regenerative medicine applications. Statement of significance The beneficial effects of human MSC (HMSC) therapy are attributable to paracrine effects of the HMSC derived EVs. While EV engineering has the potential to impact several fields of regenerative medicine, targeted delivery of the engineered EVs with spatial and temporal control is necessary to prevent off target effects and enhance tissue specificity. Here, we have leveraged the interactions of MSC EVs with ECM proteins to develop a tethering system that can be utilized to prolong EV delivery in vivo while maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the EVs. Our work has provided a tunable platform for EV delivery that we envision can be formulated as an injectable material or a bulk hydrogel suitable for regenerative medicine applications.

In addition, microRNAs contributing to the healing of various bone fractures have attracted widespread attention in recent years, but knowledge of the mechanisms by which they act is still very limited. In this study, we clarified the function of altered microRNA-19b (miR-19b) expression in BMSCs in fracture healing. We modulated miR-19b expression via mimics/inhibitors in BMSCs and via agomirs in mice to explore the effects of these changes on osteogenic factors, bone cell mineralization and the healing status of modeled fractures. Through gain- and loss-of function assays, the binding affinity between miR-19b and WWP1/Smurf2 was identified and characterized to explain the underlying mechanism involving the KLF5/beta-catenin signaling pathway. miR-19b promoted the differentiation of human BMSCs into osteoblasts by targeting WWP1 and Smurf2. Overexpression of WWP1 or Smurf2 degraded the target protein KLF5 in BMSCs through ubiquitination to inhibit fracture healing. KLF5 knockdown delayed fracture healing by modulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, miR-19b enhanced fracture healing via the KLF5/beta-catenin signaling pathway by targeting WWP1 or Smurf2. Moreover, miR-19b was found to be enriched in BMSC-derived exosomes, and treatment with exosomes promoted fracture healing in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate that mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomal miR-19b represses the expression of WWP1 or Smurf2 and elevates KLF5 expression through the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, thereby facilitating fracture healing. Bone healing: Small RNA molecule implicated in fracture repair Understanding how a small regulatory RNA molecule helps to promote fracture healing could lead to new treatments for broken bones. Working with human cells and mouse models, a team led by Yongqiang Xu from the Hunan Provincial People's Hospital in Changsha, China, showed how microRNA-19b in extracellular vesicles secreted by bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) contributes to the healing process. The researchers found that the microRNA blocks the function of two proteins that normally restrain the activity of a third protein needed for BMSCs to home in on the site of injury and turn into new bone tissue. In mice with leg bone fractures, injections of microRNA-19b-filled vesicles derived from BMSCs accelerated healing and recovery, suggesting that similar therapies might be helpful in human patients.","2021-05","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:16","973-985","","5","53","","Exp.

Here, we introduced coculture system to engineer bone mimetic ECM niche guided by cell-cell communication. In the cocultures, fibroblasts promoted osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts via extracellular vesicles. The generated ECM (MN-ECM) displayed a unique appearance of morphology and biological components. The advantages of MN-ECM were demonstrated with promotion of multiple cellular behaviors (proliferation, adhesion and osteogenic mineralization) in vitro and bone regeneration in vivo. Moreover, proteomic analysis was used to clarify the molecular mechanism of MN-ECM, which revealed a specific matrisome signature. The present study provides a novel strategy to generate ECM with tissue mimetic niches via cell-cell communication in a coculture system, which forwards the development of tissue-bioactive ECM engineering along with deepening the understanding of ECM niches regulated by cells for bone tissue engineering.","2020-12","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:17","2024-01-26 18:23:16","938-948","","4","5","","Bioact.

To determine the effect of diabetic microenvironment on EVs secreted by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), this work explores the effect of normal glucose (5.5 mm) cultured BMSCs derived EVs (NG-EVs) and high glucose (30 mm) cultured BMSCs derived EVs (HG-EVs) in regulating the migration, proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. In order to improve the bioavailability of EVs, this work constructs a sustained release system of polydopamine (PDA) functionalized 3D printing gelatin/hyaluronic acid/nano-hydroxyapatite (Gel/HA/nHAP) scaffolds (S/PDA) and verifies its function in the calvarial defect model of diabetic rats. This work confirms that both NG-EVs and HG-EVs can promote proliferation and migration, inhibit apoptosis and promote osteogenic differentiation, but the function of HG-EVs is weaker than that of NG-EVs. Therefore, EVs secreted by autologous cells of diabetic patients are not suitable for self-repair.

Despite their potential, EVs short half-life following systemic administration hinders their therapeutic efficacy. EVs have been reported to bind to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and play an essential role in matrix mineralisation. Chitosan and collagen type I are naturally-derived pro-osteogenic biomaterials, which have been demonstrated to control EV release kinetics. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an injectable ECM-mimetic hydrogel capable of controlling the release of osteoblast-derived EVs to promote bone repair. Pure chitosan hydrogels significantly enhanced compressive modulus (2.48-fold) and osteogenic differentiation (3.07-fold), whilst reducing gelation times (2.09-fold) and proliferation (2.7-fold) compared to pure collagen gels (p <= 0.001). EV release was strongly associated with collagen concentration (R-2 > 0.94), where a significantly increased EV release profile was observed from chitosan containing gels using the CD63 ELISA (p <= 0.001). Hydrogel-released EVs enhanced human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) proliferation (1.12-fold), migration (2.55-fold), and mineralisation (3.25-fold) compared to untreated cells (p <= 0.001). Importantly, EV-functionalised chitosan-collagen composites significantly promoted hBMSCs extracellular matrix mineralisation when compared to the EV-free gels in a dose-dependent manner (p <= 0.001).

Abundant t-sEVs are produced by a facile cellular nanoelectroporation system based on a commercially available track-etched membrane (TM-nanoEP) to deliver plasmid DNAs to human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAdMSCs). Upregulated microRNAs associated with the therapeutic mRNAs are enriched in t-sEVs for enhanced angiogenic-osteogenic regeneration. Localized and controlled release of t-sEVs within the PEGS-A hydrogel leads to the retention of therapeutics in the defect site for highly efficient bone regeneration with minimal low accumulation in other organs. This study describes an easily scalable and cost-effective method to produce abundant therapeutic small extracellular vesicles (t-sEVs) carrying a cocktail of functional mRNAs (VEGF-A and BMP-2) within a customized injectable PEGylated poly (glycerol sebacate) acrylate (PEGS-A) hydrogel cage for coupling bone regeneration in rats that have challenging femur critical-size defects.image","2023-10-17","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:39","","","","","","Adv.

This study aims to investigate the effect of a new drug delivery method of aspirin on the immune microenvironment of periodontitis to promote alveolar bone repair, and to explore mechanism of aspirin's effect on macrophage. Methods: We isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) from periodontal stem cells (PDLSCs) and loaded with aspirin by sonication, and then evaluated the treatment efficacy of aspirin-loaded vesicles (EVs-ASP) in periodontitis model in mice. In vitro, we explored the role of EVs-ASP in the regulation of LPS-induced macrophages. The underlying mechanism by which EVs-ASP regulates phenotypic remodeling of mac-rophages in periodontitis was further investigated. Results: EVs-ASP inhibited the inflammatory environment of LPS-induced macrophage, and promoted anti-inflammatory macrophages formation both in vivo and in vitro, and reduced bone loss in peri-odontitis models. Moreover, EVs-ASP enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and suppressed glycolysis in macrophages. Conclusions: Consequently, EVs-ASP improves the periodontal immune microenvironment by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in macrophages, resulting in a certain degree of regeneration of alveolar bone height.

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are commonly used to promote vessel formation and osteoblastic differentiation in tissue engineering. Previous studies have demonstrated that EPCs regulate both proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Understanding this mechanism is critical to developing more effective treatments. The role of extracellular vesicles in cell-to-cell communication has attracted substantial attention. These small vesicles deliver proteins, DNA, and RNA and consequently regulate the commitment, function, and differentiation of target cells. In the present study, EPC-derived extracellular vesicles (EPC-EVs were isolated using gradient ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration and the influence of EPC-EVs on BMSC osteoblastic differentiation and proliferation was examined in vitro. The results indicated that EPC-EVs regulate the osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs by inhibiting the expression of osteogenic genes and increasing proliferation in vitro. It is suggested that the results regarding the role of EPC-EVs will provide a novel way to explain the crosstalk between EPCs and BMSCs.","2017-11","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:39","7018-7024","","5","16","","Mol.

First, purified human perivascular stem cells (PSCs) were observed to induce mitogenic, pro-migratory, and pro-osteogenic effects on osteoprogenitor cells while in non-contact co-culture via elaboration of EVs. PSC-derived EVs shared mitogenic, pro-migratory, and pro-osteogenic properties of their parent cell. PSC-EV effects were dependent on surface-associated tetraspanins, as demonstrated by EV trypsinization, or neutralizing antibodies for CD9 or CD81. Moreover, shRNA knockdown in recipient cells demonstrated requirement for the CD9/CD81 binding partners IGSF8 and PTGFRN for EV bioactivity. Finally, PSC-EVs stimulated bone repair, and did so via stimulation of skeletal cell proliferation, migration, and osteodifferentiation. In sum, PSC-EVs mediate the same tissue repair effects of perivascular stem cells, and represent an 'off-the-shelf' alternative for bone tissue regeneration.","2019-09-04","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:39","e48191","","","8","","eLife","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 23 Place: Cambridge Publisher: Elife Sciences Publications Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000488049500001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\EH3UW4A4\Xu et al. - 2019 - Human perivascular stem cell-derived extracellular.pdf","","","CD9; DIFFERENTIATION; EMERGING ROLES; EXOSOMES; OSTEOGENESIS; PERICYTES; PROLIFERATION; REGENERATION; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; STROMAL CELLS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the molecular changes in serum-derived exosomes (SDEs) from aged patients with low bone density and their functions in bone remodeling remain to be fully elucidated. We present a quantitative proteomics analysis of exosomes purified from the serum of the elderly patients with osteoporosis/osteopenia and normal volunteers; these data are available via Proteome Xchange with the identifier PXD006463. Overall, 1,371 proteins were identified with an overlap of 1,160 Gene IDs among the ExoCarta proteins. Bioinformatics analysis and invitro studies suggested that protein changes in SDEs of osteoporosis patients are not only involved in suppressing the integrin-mediated mechanosensation and activation of osteoblastic cells, but also trigger the differentiation and resorption of osteoclasts. In contrast, the main changes in SDEs of osteopenia patients facilitated both activation of osteoclasts and formation of new bone mass, which could result in a compensatory elevation in bone remodeling. While the SDEs from aged normal volunteers might play a protective role in bone health through facilitating adhesion of bone cells and suppressing aging-associated oxidative stress. This information will be helpful in elucidating the pathophysiological functions of SDEs and aid in the development of senile osteoporosis diagnostics and therapeutics.","2018-06","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:39","e12758","","3","17","","Aging Cell","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 15 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000431962300023","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\YMG7XDFR\Xie et al. - 2018 - Involvement of serum-derived exosomes of elderly p.pdf","","","BIOGENESIS; bone remodeling; CELLS; CROSS-TALK; DIFFERENTIATION; ENRICHMENT; exosome; EXPRESSION; GENES; INTERACTION NETWORK; osteoblasts; osteoclasts; osteoporosis; SECRETION; TGF-BETA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients with TBI and associated fractures experience shorter fracture recovery times than patients with fractures only, but precisely why is unclear. Ze Lin at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, and co-workers examined molecules released during recovery in samples taken from patients with TBI and fractures, those with fractures only, and mouse models with femur fractures. They found that exosomes (extracellular vesicles that transport metabolites including microRNA) released following TBI are enriched with miRNA-21-5 p, which enhances differentiation of bone-forming cells and bone repair. No miRNA-21-5 p enrichment occurred in patients with fractures only. Knocking out exosomal miRNA-21-5 p impaired bone repair in mice, while injecting exosomes from TBI patients boosted bone formation. Fracture combined with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common and serious types of compound trauma in the clinic and is characterized by dysfunction of cellular communication in injured organs. Our prior studies found that TBI was capable of enhancing fracture healing in a paracrine manner. Exosomes (Exos), as small extracellular vesicles, are important paracrine vehicles for noncell therapy. However, whether circulating Exos derived from TBI patients (TBI-Exos) regulate the prohealing effects of fractures remains unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to explore the biological effects of TBI-Exos on fracture healing and reveal the potential molecular mechanism. TBI-Exos were isolated by ultracentrifugation, and the enriched miR-21-5 p was identified by qRT-PCR analysis. The beneficial effects of TBI-Exos on osteoblastic differentiation and bone remodeling were determined by a series of in vitro assays. Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to identify the potential downstream mechanisms of the regulatory effect of TBI-Exos on osteoblasts. Furthermore, the role of the potential signaling pathway of TBI-Exos in mediating the osteoblastic activity of osteoblasts was assessed. Subsequently, a murine fracture model was established, and the effect of TBI-Exos on bone modeling was demonstrated in vivo. TBI-Exos can be internalized by osteoblasts, and in vitro, suppression of SMAD7 promoted osteogenic differentiation, whereas knockdown of miR-21-5 p in TBI-Exos strongly inhibited this bone-beneficial effect. Similarly, our results confirmed that preinjection of TBI-Exos led to enhanced bone formation, whereas knockdown of exosomal miR-21-5 p substantially impaired this bone-beneficial effect in vivo.","2023-03","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:39","587-596","","3","55","","Exp.

Design: Extracellular vesicle phenotypes were measured in blinded serum samples from 15 adults with HIV at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after ART initiation. Not all samples were available at each time point so we averaged early (TP1, 1-3 months) and late (TP2, 6-12 months) time points. Methods: Extracellular vesicles were stained for osteocalcin (OC), RANKL (CD254), RANK (CD265), M-CSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor), and CD34. Serum OC, procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), and C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx) were also measured. Results: BMD significantly decreased from baseline to 12 months. Levels of OC+EVs, serum OC, serum P1NP, and CTx were significantly higher at early and late time points compared with baseline. Increases in EVs expressing OC, RANKL, RANK, and CD34 from baseline to TP1 were associated with decreases in total hip BMD from baseline to 12 months. Change in serum OC, P1NP, and CTx from baseline to TP1 or TP2 did not correlate with change in BMD. Conclusion: Early changes in extracellular vesicles expressing markers of bone activity were associated with total hip bone loss 12 months after ART initiation. These data suggest that serum extracellular vesicles may serve as novel biomarkers of bone remodeling. Future studies are required to determine if extracellular vesicles contribute to the effects of ART on changes in bone turnover markers and BMD.","2020-03-01","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:39","351-361","","3","34","","Aids","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 11 Place: Philadelphia Publisher: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Web of Science ID: WOS:000544898400002","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\GMTHKL45\de Menezes et al. - 2020 - Serum extracellular vesicles expressing bone activ.pdf","","","ABACAVIR-LAMIVUDINE; antiretroviral therapy; bone mineral density; bone remodeling; CELLS; DIFFERENTIATION; EXOSOMES; extracellular vesicles; HIV; IDENTIFICATION; INITIATION; MINERAL DENSITY; OSTEOBLASTS; osteocalcin; RANKL EXPRESSION; receptor activator of NF-kB ligand; TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL FUMARATE/EMTRICITABINE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These factors can be found in the conditioned medium (CM) collected from cell cultures, and it is believed that extracellular vesicles (EVs) within this CM are at least partially responsible for MPC therapeutic efficacy. This study aimed to examine the functionality of the EV fraction of CM compared to whole CM obtained from human adipose-derived MPCs in an in vivo murine cartilage defect model. Mice treated with whole CM or the EV fraction demonstrated an enhanced cartilage repair score and type II collagen deposition at the injury site compared to saline controls. We then developed a scalable bioprocess using stirred suspension bioreactors (SSBs) to generate clinically relevant quantities of MPC-EVs. Whereas static monolayer culture systems are simple to use and readily accessible, SSBs offer increased scalability and a more homogenous environment due to constant mixing. This study evaluated the biochemical and functional properties of MPCs and their EV fractions generated in static culture versus SSBs. Functionality was assessed using in vitro MPC chondrogenesis as an outcome measure. SSBs supported increased MPC expression of cartilage-specific genes, and EV fractions derived from both static and SSB culture systems upregulated type II collagen production by MPCs. These results suggest that SSBs are an effective platform for the generation of MPC-derived EVs with the potential to induce cartilage repair.","2022-03-03","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:39","73-87","","1","11","","Stem Cells Transl.

MSCs are known to reside in low oxygen tension, which promotes osteogenic differentiation via hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha activation. Epigenetic reprogramming has emerged as a promising bioengineering strategy to enhance MSC differentiation. Particularly, the process of hypomethylation may enhance osteogenesis through gene activation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of inducing hypomethylation and hypoxia on improving the therapeutic efficacy of EVs derived from human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSCs). The effects of the hypoxia mimetic agent deferoxamine (DFO) and the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (AZT) on hBMSC viability was assessed by quantifying the DNA content. The epigenetic functionality was evaluated by assessing histone acetylation and histone methylation. hBMSC mineralisation was determined by quantifying alkaline phosphate activity, collagen production and calcium deposition. EVs were procured from AZT, DFO or AZT/DFO-treated hBMSCs over a two-week period, with EV size and concentration defined using transmission electron microscopy, nanoflow cytometry and dynamic light scattering. The effects of AZT-EVs, DFO-EVs or AZT/DFO-EVs on the epigenetic functionality and mineralisation of hBMSCs were evaluated. Moreover, the effects of hBMSC-EVs on human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) angiogenesis was assessed by quantifying pro-angiogenic cytokine release. DFO and AZT caused a time-dose dependent reduction in hBMSC viability. Pre-treatment with AZT, DFO or AZT/DFO augmented the epigenetic functionality of the MSCs through increases in histone acetylation and hypomethylation. AZT, DFO and AZT/DFO pre-treatment significantly enhanced extracellular matrix collagen production and mineralisation in hBMSCs. EVs derived from AZT/DFO-preconditioned hBMSCs (AZT/DFO-EVs) enhanced the hBMSC proliferation, histone acetylation and hypomethylation when compared to EVs derived from AZT-treated, DFO-treated and untreated hBMSCs. Importantly, AZT/DFO-EVs significantly increased osteogenic differentiation and mineralisation of a secondary hBMSC population. Furthermore, AZT/DFO-EVs enhanced the pro-angiogenic cytokine release of HUVECs. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the considerable utility of synergistically inducing hypomethylation and hypoxia to improve the therapeutic efficacy of the MSC-EVs as a cell-free approach for bone regeneration.","2023-04","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:40","7564","","8","24","","Int.

Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have shown great potential in regulating bone remodeling. Here, we aimed to explore the effects of periodontal ligament stem cell (PDLSC)-derived EVs on tension-induced osteogenesis and the potential mechanism. PDLSC-derived EVs were extracted by ultracentrifugation. In vitro, PDLSC-derived EVs of 10 mu g/mL significantly improved the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells and enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts under a tensile strain of 2000 u epsilon. Next, a mouse model of orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) was established and treated with subperiosteal injection of PDLSC-derived EVs (1 mg/kg) on the tension side. The results showed that treatment with PDLSC-derived EVs effectively enhanced OTM and promoted osteogenesis on the tension side, including increasing trabecular bone parameters and promoting the expression of osteogenic-related biomarkers (OCN and OPN). More interestingly, we identified several mechano-sensitive miRNAs enriched in PDLSC-derived EVs by high-throughput miRNA sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that they were related to various osteogenesis-related signaling pathways. Therefore, PDLSC-derived EVs could improve the efficiency of OTM by enhancing tension-induced osteogenesis of osteoblasts. Our study may provide potential evidence for the promoting effects of PDLSC-derived EVs on osteogenesis and offer new insights into the development of treatment strategies for enhancing osteogenesis in orthodontic treatment and other metabolic bone diseases.","2022-12-20","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:40","","","","","","ACS Biomater.

Monocytes (MCs) and osteoclasts actively take part in controlling bone remodelling by providing signals that promote osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have attracted attention as regulators of bone remodelling. EVs facilitate intercellular communication by transferring a complex cargo of biologically active molecules to target cells. In the present study, we evaluated the potency of EVs from MCs and osteoclasts to induce a lineage-specific response in MSCs. We analysed gene expression and protein secretion by both adipose tissue-derived MSCs and bone marrow-derived MSCs after stimulation with EVs from lipopolysaccharide-activated primary human MCs and (mineral-resorbing) osteoclasts. Isolated EVs were enriched in exosomes (EVs of endosomal origin) and were free of cell debris. MC- and osteoclast-derived EVs were taken up by adipose tissue-derived MSCs. EVs from activated MCs promoted the secretion of cytokines by MSCs, which may represent an immunomodulatory mechanism. MC-derived EVs also upregulated the expression of genes encoding for matrix metalloproteinases. Therefore, we hypothesize that MCs facilitate tissue remodelling through EV-mediated signalling. We did not observe a significant effect of osteoclast-derived EVs on gene expression or protein secretion in MSCs. EV-mediated signalling might represent an additional mode of cell-cell signalling during the transition from injury and inflammation to bone regeneration and play an important role in the coupling between bone resorption and bone formation.

However, the significance of osteoblast-derived extracellular vesicles on osteogenesis has not been fully established. In this present study, we aim to investigate the therapeutic potential of extracellular vesicles secreted from consecutive 14 days of dexamethasone-stimulated osteoblasts (OB-EVDex) to act as a biomimetic tool for regulating osteogenesis, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. OB-EVdex treated groups are compared to the clinically used osteo-inductor of BMP-2 as control. Our findings revealed that OB-EVDex have a typical bilayer membrane nanostructure of, with an average diameter of 178 +/- 21 nm, and that fluorescently labeled OB-EVDex were engulfed by osteoblasts in a time-dependent manner. The proliferation, attachment, and viability capacities of OB-EVDex-treated osteoblasts were significantly improved when compared to untreated cells, with the highest proliferative rate observed in the OB-EVDex + BMP-2 group. Notably, combinations of OB-EVDex and BMP-2 markedly promoted osteogenic differentiation by positively upregulating osteogenesis-related gene expression levels of RUNX2, BGLAP, SPP1, SPARC, Col 1A1, and ALPL relative to BMP-2 or OB-EVDex treatment alone. Mineralization assays also showed greater pro-osteogenic potency after combined applications of OB-EVDex and BMP-2, as evidenced by a notable increase in mineralized nodules (calcium deposition) revealed by Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Alizarin Red Alizarin Red staining (ARS), and von Kossa staining. Therefore, our findings shed light on the potential of OB-EVDex as a new therapeutic option for enhancing osteogenesis.","2023-03-10","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:40","1160703","","","11","","Front.

EVs released from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-EVs) have the potential to treat multiple diseases. This study aimed to determine the effects of MSC-EVs on bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ), whose pathogenesis and treatment are not yet established. To this end, zoledronic acid (ZOL) was administered to bone marrow cells and fibroblasts in vitro. In vivo, a BRONJ model was produced by administering ZOL to rats and extracting teeth. Each MSC-EV-treated and nontreated group was compared histologically and molecularly. In vitro, the nontreated group showed an increased number of beta-galactosidase-positive cells and expression of senescence-associated genes p21, pRB and senescence-related inflammatory cytokines. Conversely, MSC-EV administration decreased the number of senescent cells and expression levels of p21, pRB and inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, in the nontreated group, the socket was partially uncovered by the oral epithelium, leaving an exposed bone. Conversely, in the MSC-EV-treated group, the socket was healed. Besides, in the nontreated group, beta-galactosidase-positive cells existed in the socket and colocalized with the CD90 and periostin-positive cells. However, there were few beta-galactosidase-positive cells in the MSC-EV-treated group. Furthermore, gene expression of stem cell markers Bmi1 and Hmga2 and the vascular endothelial marker VEGF was significantly increased in the MSC-EV-treated group, compared with that in the nontreated group. These results indicate that MSC-EVs prevent ZOL-induced senescence in stem cells, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts and reduce inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, administration of MSC-EVs prevented senescence of cells involved in wound healing and the spread of chronic inflammation around senescent cells, thereby promoting angiogenesis and bone regeneration and preventing BRONJ.","2020-05","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:40","552-560","","5","99","","J.

EVs were harvested from rat bone marrow-derived MSCs and the pro-angiogenic potential of EVs was investigated in vitro. DBM scaffolds were then coated with EVs, and the modification was verified by scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. Next, the pro-angiogenic and pro-bone regeneration activities of EV-modified scaffolds were evaluated in a subcutaneous bone formation model in nude mice. Micro-computed tomography scanning analysis showed that EV-modified scaffolds with seeded cells enhanced bone formation. Enhanced bone formation was confirmed by histological analysis. Immunohistochemical staining for CD31 proved that EV-modified scaffolds promoted vascularization in the grafts, thereby enhancing bone regeneration.

Stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) provide another choice for osteoporosis therapy. Mouse mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs)-derived EVs promote bone regeneration; however, their clinical application is limited due to non-specific tissue targeting. Alendronate specifically targets bone tissue via hydroxyapatite. Therefore, EVs were combined with alendronate to generate Ale-EVs by ""click chemistry"" to facilitate EVs targeting bone via alendronate/hydroxyapatite binding. Methods: Ale-EVs were characterized based on size using dynamic light scattering analysis and morphology was visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Hydroxyapatite affinity of Ale-EVs was detected by flow cytometry. Bone targeting of Ale-EVs was tested by ex vivo fluorescent imaging. Cell viability was assessed by using WST-8 reduction assay kit for testing the ability of Ale-EVs to promote mMSCs proliferation. Alkaline phosphatase experiment was used to detect ability of Ale-EVs to promote differentiation of mouse mesenchymal stem cells in vitro. Western blotting and Q-PCR assay were used to detect the early marker of osteogenic differentiation. Antiosteoporotic effects of Ale-EVs were detected in ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis rat model. The safety of the Ale-EVs in vivo was measured by H&E staining and serum markers assay. Results: In vitro, Ale-EVs had high affinity with hydroxyapatite. Also, ex vivo data indicated that Ale-EVs-DiD treatment of mice induced strong fluorescece in bone tissues compared with EVs-DiD group. Furthermore, results suggested that Ale-EVs promoted the growth and differentiation of mouse MSCs. They also protected against osteoporosis in ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporotic rats. Ale-EVs were well tolerated and no side effects were found, indicating that Ale-EVs specifically target bone and can be used as a new therapeutic in osteoporosis treatment. Conclusion: We used the Ale-N3 to modify mouse mesenchymal stem cells-derived extra-cellular vesicles by copper-free ""click chemistry"" to generate a Ale-EVs system. The Ale-EVs had a high affinity for bone and have great potential for clinical applications in osteoporosis therapy with low systemic toxicity.","2020","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:40","7967-7977","","","15","","Int.

In the present study, a new strategy to improve SB osteoinductivity was developed. SB scaffolds were loaded with lyosecretome, a freeze-dried formulation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-secretome, containing proteins and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Lyosecretome-loaded SB scaffolds (SBlyo) were prepared using an absorption method. A burst release of proteins and EVs (38% and 50% after 30 min, respectively) was observed, and then proteins were released more slowly with respect to EVs, most likely because they more strongly adsorbed onto the SB surface. In vitro tests were conducted using adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) plated on SB or SBlyo. After 14 days, significant cell proliferation improvement was observed on SBlyo with respect to SB, where cells filled the cavities between the native trabeculae. On SB, on the other hand, the process was still present, but tissue formation was less organized at 60 days. On both scaffolds, cells differentiated into osteoblasts and were able to mineralize after 60 days. Nonetheless, SBlyo showed a higher expression of osteoblast markers and a higher quantity of newly formed trabeculae than SB alone. The quantification analysis of the newly formed mineralized tissue and the immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that SBlyo induces bone formation more effectively. This osteoinductive effect is likely due to the osteogenic factors present in the lyosecretome, such as fibronectin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A, and TGF-beta.","2021-04","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:40","4064","","8","22","","Int.

The present study aimed to design a new GelMA-HAMA/nHAP composite hydrogel as a drug delivery system. The USCEXOs were encapsulated and slow-released in the hydrogel for better osteogenesis. The characterization of the GelMA-based hydrogel showed excellent controlled release performance and appropriate mechanical properties. The in vitro studies showed that the USCEXOs/GelMA-HAMA/nHAP composite hydrogel could promote the osteogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and the angiogenesis of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), respec-tively. Meanwhile, the in vivo results confirmed that this composite hydrogel could significantly promote the defect repair of cranial bone in the rat model.

Platelet lysates (PL) as a pool of growth factors (GFs) were widely used in local bone repair by its potent pro-regeneration and pro-angiogenesis. However, it is still seldom applied for treating systemic osteopathia due to the lack of a suitable delivery strategy. The non-targeted distribution of GFs might cause tumorigenesis in other organs. Results: In this study, PL-derived exosomes (PL-exo) were isolated to enrich the platelet-derived GFs, followed by conjugating with alendronate (ALN) grafted PEGylated phospholipid (DSPE-PEG-ALN) to establish a bone-targeting PL-exo (PL-exo-ALN). The in vitro hydroxyapatite binding affinity and in vivo bone targeting aggregation of PL-exo were significantly enhanced after ALN modification. Besides directly modulating the osteogenic and angiogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), respectively, PL-exo-ALN also facilitate their coupling under GCs'stimulation.

In this study, we aimed to design Bmp2 mRNA-enriched engineered exosomes, which were then loaded into specific hydrogel to achieve sustained release for more efficient and safe bone regeneration.ResultsBmp2 mRNA was enriched into exosomes by selective inhibition of translation in donor cells, in which NoBody (non-annotated P-body dissociating polypeptide, a protein that inhibits mRNA translation) and modified engineered BMP2 plasmids were co-transfected. The derived exosomes were named Exo(BMP2+NoBody). In vitro experiments confirmed that Exo(BMP2+NoBody) had higher abundance of Bmp2 mRNA and thus stronger osteogenic induction capacity. When loaded into GelMA hydrogel via ally-L-glycine modified CP05 linker, the exosomes could be slowly released and thus ensure prolonged effect of BMP2 when endocytosed by the recipient cells. In the in vivo calvarial defect model, Exo(BMP2+NoBody)-loaded GelMA displayed great capacity in promoting bone regeneration.ConclusionsTogether, the proposed Exo(BMP2+NoBody)-loaded GelMA can provide an efficient and innovative strategy for bone regeneration.","2023-04-05","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:41","119","","1","21","","J.

Characteristically, PCa causes osteosclerotic lesions as a result of disrupted bone remodeling. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) participate in PCa progression by conditioning the pre-metastatic niche. However, how EVs mediate the cross-talk between PCa cells and osteoprogenitors in the bone microenvironment remains poorly understood. We found that EVs derived from murine PCa cell line RM1-BM increased metabolic activity, vitality, and cell proliferation of osteoblast precursors by >60%, while significantly impairing mineral deposition (-37%). The latter was further confirmed in two complementary in vivo models of ossification. Accordingly, gene and protein set enrichments of osteoprogenitors exposed to EVs displayed significant downregulation of osteogenic markers and upregulation of proinflammatory factors. Additionally, transcriptomic profiling of PCa-EVs revealed the abundance of three microRNAs, miR-26a-5p, miR-27a-3p, and miR-30e-5p involved in the suppression of BMP-2-induced osteogenesis in vivo, suggesting the critical role of these EV-derived miRNAs in PCa-mediated suppression of osteoblast activity. Taken together, our results indicate the importance of EV cargo in cancer-bone cross-talk in vitro and in vivo and suggest that exosomal miRNAs may contribute to the onset of osteosclerotic bone lesions in PCa.","2022-02","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:41","1285","","3","23","","Int.

Considering that exosomes are critical paracrine mediators for intercellular communication that exert important effects in tissue repair, the aim of this study is to confirm the function and molecular mechanisms of Schwann cell-derived exosomes (SC-exos) on bone regeneration and to propose engineered constructs that simulate SC-mediated nerve-bone crosstalk. SCs promoted the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) through exosomes. Subsequent molecular mechanism studies demonstrated that SC-exos promoted BMSC osteogenesis by regulating the TGF-beta signaling pathway via let-7c-5p. Interestingly, SC-exos promoted the migration and tube formation performance of endothelial progenitor cells. Furthermore, the SC-exos@G/S constructs were developed by bioprinting tech-nology that simulated SC-mediated nerve-bone crosstalk and improved the bone regeneration microenvironment by releasing SC-exos, exerting the regulatory effect of SCs in the microenvironment to promote innervation, vascularization, and osteogenesis and thus effectively improving bone repair in a cranial defect model.

Materials and Methods Exosomes enriched with miR-375 (Exo [miR-375]) were generated from hASCs stably overexpressing miR-375 after lentiviral transfection and identified with transmission electron microscopy, nanosight and western blotting. The construction efficiency of Exo (miR-375) was evaluated with qRT-PCR and incubated with human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) to optimize the effective dosage. Then, the osteogenic capability of Exo (miR-375) was investigated with ALP and ARS assays. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blotting were conducted to reveal the underlying mechanism of miR-375 in osteogenic regulation. Finally, Exo (miR-375) were embedded with hydrogel and applied to a rat model of calvarial defect, and mu-CT analysis and histological examination were conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Exo (miR-375) in bone regeneration. Results miR-375 could be enriched in exosomes by overexpressing in the parent cells. Administration of Exo (miR-375) at 50 mu g/mL improved the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. With miR-375 absorbed by hBMSCs, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) was inhibited by binding to its 3 ' UTR, and recombinant IGFBP3 protein reduced the osteogenic effects triggered by Exo (miR-375). After incorporated with hydrogel, Exo (miR-375) displayed a slow and controlled release, and further in vivo analysis demonstrated that Exo (miR-375) enhanced the bone regenerative capacity in a rat model of calvarial defect. Conclusions Taken together, our study demonstrated that exosomes derived from miR-375-overexpressing hASCs promoted bone regeneration.","2019-09","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:41","e12669","","5","52","","Cell Prolif.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 14 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000478850700001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\CXT5XMXX\Chen et al. - 2019 - Exosomes derived from miR-375-overexpressing human.pdf","","","adipose mesenchymal stem cells; ANGIOGENESIS; bone regeneration; DELIVERY; exosomes; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; gene delivery; MEDICINE; MICRORNA; miR-375; MSC; OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; PHARMACOKINETICS; TISSUE; VEHICLES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although miRNAs have gained significant attention in oncology and in work on genetic disorders and autoimmune diseases, their application in tissue regeneration remains hindered by several challenges, such as miRNA degradation. Here, we reported Exosome@MicroRNA-26a (Exo@miR-26a), an osteoinductive factor that can be substituted for routinely used growth factors, which was constructed using bone marrow stem cell (BMSC)-derived exosomes and microRNA-26a (miR-26a). Exo@miR-26a-integrated hydrogels significantly promoted bone regeneration when implanted into defect sites; as the exosome stimulated angiogenesis, miR-26a promoted osteogenesis while the hydrogel enabled a site-directed release. Moreover, BMSC-derived exosomes further facilitated healthy bone regeneration by repressing osteoclast differentiationrelated genes rather than damaging osteoclasts.

In this study, we modified probiotics Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (ECN) to overexpress hCXCR4 fused with the ClyA on the membrane surface of BEVs. The bone targeted BEVs took advantage of the intrinsic anti-OP function and loaded with SOST siRNA to generate BEVs-hCXCR4-SOST siRNA (BEVs-CSs). The customized BEVs-CSs have exhibited great bone targeting ability without long-term cytotoxicity. In addition, the bioengineered BEVs-CSs can be internalized by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell and promote their osteogenic differentiation with significant cytocompatibility. Finally, the bifunctional BEVs-CSs successfully reversed the OP in an ovariectomized mouse model.

DC-EV were readily internalized by human bone marrow-derived MSC, without impacting significantly their proliferation or influencing their osteogenic/chondrogenic differentiation.

DC-EV content was analysed by chemokine array, indicating the presence of chemotactic mediators. Osteopontin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were confirmed inside EV.

In the current study, to investigate the differentiation effects of human articular chondrocyte EVs on adipose-derived MSCs, they were cultured in injectable chitosan-hyaluronic acid (CS-HA) hydrogel and then treated with chondrocyte EVs for 21 days. The continuous treatment of EVs performed on MSCs increased chondrogenic genes' expressions of SOX9 and COL2A1 and induced expression of Col II protein. In addition, glycosaminoglycans secretion was detected in the EV-treated MSCs after about 14 days. The therapeutic efficiency of this hydrogel and EVs was studied in a rabbit osteochondral defect model. MRI results revealed that the cartilage regeneration capacity of EV-treated MSCs with CS-HA hydrogel was greater than the untreated MSCs or the EV-treated MSCs without hydrogel. Moreover, histological results showed hyaline-like cartilage in the CS-HA/MSC and CS-HA/EV/MSC groups in the cartilage defect sites.

Recent studies show that the regulation of osteoblasts (OBs) by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) is an important mechanism in alleviating DBD and that exosomes are recognized as the key medium. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosome (MSC-Exos) therapy is a promising approach to facilitate tissue repair. However, the influence of exosomes from diabetic conditioned BMSCs on OBs and bone regeneration, as well as the underlying mechanism, are still elusive. Here, we used high-glucose medium to mimic diabetic conditions and normal-glucose medium as control to mimic nondiabetic conditions in vitro and found that microRNA-17 (miR-17) was downregulated in diabetic-conditioned BMSC-derived exosomes (HG-Exos), HG-Exo-co-cultured osteoblasts, and the skull of rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Further experiment concluded that nondiabetic conditioned BMSC-Exos (NG-Exos) promoted the osteogenesis of OBs and bone regeneration of rats with T2DM via upregulation of miR-17. Compare with NG-Exos, HG-Exos impeded osteogenesis of OBs in vitro and bone regeneration of rats in vivo by downregulation of miR-17. Moreover, miR-17 promoted bone regeneration by targeting SMAD7, which was further proved to have a negative effect on osteogenesis. Taken together, nondiabetic BMSC-derived exosomes greatly foster bone regeneration, whereas diabetic BMSC-derived exosomes undermine the promotion effect of MSC-Exos by regulating the miR-17/SMAD7 axis. These findings provide support for the miR-17-5p/SMAD7 axis as a promising therapeutic target to treat DBD.","2023-12","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:42","111190","","","125","","Int.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have recently been shown to enhance osteogenic differentiation and improve bone mineral deposition. Herein, EVs derived from placental stem cells (PSCs) have a comparative ability to improve osteogenic capability. PSCs have advantages such as higher proliferation capacity, the ability to be harvested without an invasive procedure, and they produce larger amounts of EVs. The feasibility of using these EVs will be especially important in clinical translational studies, which require substantial amounts of EVs to achieve this effect. Stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have shown great promise in the field of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Recently, human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-derived EVs have been considered for bone tissue engineering applications. In this study, we evaluated the osteogenic capability of placental stem cell (PSC)-derived EVs and compared them to the well-characterized BMSC-derived EVs. EVs were extracted from three designated time points (0, 7, and 21 days) after osteogenic differentiation. The results showed that the PSC-derived EVs had much higher protein and lipid concentrations than EVs derived from BMSCs. The extracted EVs were characterized by observing their morphology and size distribution before utilizing next-generation sequencing to determine their microRNA (miRNA) profiles. A total of 306 miRNAs within the EVs were identified, of which 64 were significantly expressed in PSC-derived EVs that related to osteogenic differentiation. In vitro osteogenic differentiation study indicated the late-stage (21-day extracted)-derived EVs higher osteogenic enhancing capability when compared with the early stage-derived EVs. We demonstrated that EVs derived from PSCs could be a new source of EVs for bone tissue engineering applications.","2021-08-01","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:42","1044-1054","","15-16","27","","Tissue Eng.

Herein, indirect biophysical cues originating from osteocytes in combination with direct biophysical cues from melt electrowritten (MEW) scaffolds to form a single engineered construct with the aim of synergistically enhancing osteogenesis are harnessed. The secretome of mechanically activated osteocytes is collected within conditioned media (CM) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are subsequently isolated. Building on MEW microfibrous scaffolds with controlled microarchitecture and mineral nanotopography optimized for bone repair, a protocol is developed to functionalize these materials with CM or EVs. Human marrow stromal cell (MSC) proliferation is enhanced in both CM and EV functionalized scaffolds. EV functionalized scaffolds are further found to significantly enhance MSC osteogenesis, with enhanced alkaline phosphatase expression, collagen production, and mineralization compared with control scaffolds. Furthermore, enhanced formation of mineralized nodules is identified in EV functionalized materials.

Cellular mechanical memory can maintain the cell status by retaining cellular information obtained from past mechanical microenvironments. Here, we propose a new concept ""morphology memory of small extracellular vesicles (sEV)"" for bone regeneration. We performed nanotopography on titanium plates through alkali and heat (Ti8) treatment to promote human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) differentiation. Next, we extracted the sEVs from the hMSC, which were cultured on the nanotopographical Ti plates for 21 days (Ti8-21-sEV). We demonstrated that Ti8-21-sEV had superior pro-osteogenesis ability in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing further confirmed that Ti8-21-sEV promote bone regeneration through osteogenic-related pathways, including the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction. Finally, we decorated the Ti8-21-sEV on a 3D printed porous polyetheretherketone scaffold. The femoral condyle defect model of rabbits was used to demonstrate that Ti8-21-sEV had the best bone ingrowth. In summary, our study demonstrated that the Ti8-21-sEV have memory function by copying the pro-osteogenesis information from the nanotopography.

It has been predicted to become a global challenge with the aging of the world population. However, the current therapy based on antiresorptive drugs and anabolic drugs has unwanted side effects. Although cell-based treatments have shown therapeutic ef-fects for osteoporosis, there are still some limitations inhibiting the process of clinical application. In the present study, we developed EVs derived from skeletal muscle tissues (Mu-EVs) as a cell-free therapy to treat disuse-induced osteoporosis. Our results showed that Mu-EVs could be prepared easily and abun-dantly from skeletal muscle tissues, and that these Mu-EVs had typical features of extracellular vesicles. In vitro studies demonstrated that Mu-EVs from normal skeletal muscles could be phagocytized by bone marrow stromal/stem cells (BMSCs) and osteoclasts (OCs), and promoted osteogenic differentiation of BM-SCs while inhibited OCs formation. Correspondingly, Mu-EVs from atrophic skeletal muscles attenuated the osteogenesis of BMSCs and strengthened the osteoclastogenesis of monocytes. In vivo experiments revealed that Mu-EVs could efficiently reverse disuse-induced osteoporosis by enhancing bone formation and suppressing bone resorption. Collectively, our results suggest that Mu-EVs may be a potential cell -free therapy for osteoporosis treatment.Statement of significanceOsteoporosis is a highly prevalent skeletal bone disorder worldwide and has become a global health concern with the aging of the world population.

We have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived apoVs are promising therapeutic agents for bone regeneration. However, clinical translation of MSC-derived apoVs has been hindered due to cell expansion and nuclear substance. As another appealing source for apoV therapy, blood cells could potentially eliminate these limitations. However, whether blood cells can release apoVs during apoptosis is uncertain, and the detailed characteristics and biological properties of respective apoVs are not elucidated. In this study, we showed that platelets (PLTs) could rapidly release abundant apoVs during apoptosis in a short time. To recognize the different protein expressions between PLT-derived apoVs and PLTs, we established their precise protein landscape. Furthermore, we identified six proteins specifically enriched in PLT-derived apoVs, which could be considered as specific biomarkers. More importantly, PLT-derived apoVs promoted osteogenesis of MSCs and rescued bone loss via Golgi phosphoprotein 2 (GOLPH2)-induced AKT phosphorylation, therefore, leading to the emergence of their potential in bone regeneration. In summary, we comprehensively determined characteristics of PLT-derived apoVs and confirmed their roles in bone metabolism through previously unrecognized GOPLH2-dependent AKT signaling, providing more understanding for exploring apoV-based therapy in bone tissue engineering.","2023-12-04","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:42","25070-25090","","24","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 21 Place: Washington Publisher: Amer Chemical Soc Web of Science ID: WOS:001136280000001","","","","","apoptotic vesicles; bone regeneration; CELL-DEATH; EXPRESSION; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; Golgi phosphoprotein2; GP73; LIFE; mesenchymalstem cells; MICROPARTICLES INDUCE ANGIOGENESIS; platelets; STEM-CELLS; SURVIVAL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The implanted membranes may trigger early inflammatory responses as a foreign material, which can affect the recruitment and differentiation of bone cells during tissue regeneration. The purpose of this study was to determine whether immobilizing interleukin 4 (IL4) on plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII)-activated surfaces may alter the osteo-immunoregulatory characteristics of the membranes and produce pro-osteogenic effects. In order to immobilize IL4, polycaprolactone surfaces were modified using the PIII technology. No discernible alterations were found between the morphology before and after PIII treatment or IL4 immobilization. IL4immobilized PIII surfaces polarized macrophages to an M2 phenotype and mitigated inflammatory cytokine production under lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Interestingly, the co-culture of macrophages (on IL4-immobilized PIII surfaces) and bone marrowderived mesenchymal stromal cells enhanced the production of angiogenic and osteogenic factors and triggered autophagy activation. Exosomes produced by PIII + IL4-stimulated macrophages were also found to play a role in osteoblast differentiation. In conclusion, the osteo-immunoregulatory properties of bone materials can be modified by PIII-assisted IL4 immobilization, creating a favorable osteoimmune milieu for bone regeneration.","2023-01-06","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:42","","","","","","ACS Appl.

In such conditions, mesenchymal progenitor cell populations from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) present advantageous multipotent properties with easy accessibility which makes them a good candidate in both bone and periodontal tissue regeneration. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a functional membranous structure which could participate in multiple cell interactions and imitate the biological functions of their parenting cells largely. To assess their ability to mobilize naive BMSCs in the bone repair process, Nanosight Tracking Analysis (NTA) and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) were performed to illustrate the composition and functional contents of EV samples derived from SHEDs with different culturing time (24 h, 48 h, and 72 h). Afterwards, the Boyden chamber assay was performed to compare their capacity for mobilizing naive BMSCs. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post hoc Turkey test was performed for statistical analysis. SHEDs-derived EVs collected from 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h time points, namely, EV24, EV48, and EV72, were mainly secreted as exosomes and tended to reform into smaller size as a result of sonication indicated by NTA results. Moreover, different EV groups were found to be abundant with multiple growth factors including transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) given the detections through ELISA. Boyden chamber assays implied the migratory efficiency of BMSCs driven by EVs at varying concentrations. However, the results showed that migration of BMSCs driven by different EV groups was not statistically significant even with chemotactic factors contained (P>0.05). Taken together, these data suggest that EVs derived from SHEDs are secreted in functional forms and present a potential of mobilizing naive BMSCs, which may propose their relevance in assisting bone regeneration.","2021-03-17","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:42","6681771","","","2021","","Stem Cells Int.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 7 Place: London Publisher: Hindawi Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000636070600002","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\NZZFEFDR\Luo et al. - 2021 - Exploring a Chemotactic Role for EVs from Progenit.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inflammation and vascular impairment are two main causes of inadequate wound healing. Methods: Here, we developed a versatile hydrogel wound dressing, comprising a straightforward physical mixture of royal jelly-derived extracellular vesicles (RJ-EVs) and methacrylic anhydride modified sericin (SerMA), to accelerate wound healing by inhibiting inflammation and promoting vascular reparation. Results: The RJ-EVs showed satisfactory anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and significantly promoted L929 cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Meanwhile, the photocrosslinked SerMA hydrogel with its porous interior structure and high fluidity made it a good candidate for wound dressing. The RJ-EVs can be gradually released from the SerMA hydrogel at the wound site, ensuring the restorative effect of RJ-EVs. In a full-thickness skin defect model, the SerMA/RJ-EVs hydrogel dressing accelerated wound healing with a healing rate of 96.8% by improving cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The RNA sequencing results further revealed that the SerMA/RJ-EVs hydrogel dressing was involved in inflammatory damage repair-related pathways including recombinational repair, epidermis development, and Wnt signaling.

Within the bone metabolic niche, communication between periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) has been considered a major contributor to osteogenesis. PDLSC-derived extracellular vesicles (P-EVs) have shown great potential for bone regeneration. However, the secretion and uptake mechanisms of P-EVs remain elusive. Herein, the biogenesis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from PDLSCs was observed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. PDLSCs were transduced with Ras-associated protein 27a (Rab27a) siRNA (PDLSCsiRab27a) to inhibit EV secretion. The effect of P-EVs on BMMSCs was evaluated using a non-contact transwell co-culture system. We observed that Rab27a knockdown decreased EV secretion, and PDLSCsiRab27a remarkably attenuated co-culture-enhanced osteogenesis of BMMSCs. Isolated PDLSC-derived EVs enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs in vitro and induced bone regeneration in a calvarial defect model in vivo. PDLSC-derived EVs were rapidly endocytosed by BMMSCs via the lipid raft/cholesterol endocytosis pathway and triggered the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. In conclusion, PDLSCs contribute to the osteogenesis of BMMSCs through Rab27a-mediated EV secretion, thereby providing a potential cell-free approach for bone regeneration.","2023-05-25","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:43","8479","","1","13","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 15 Place: Berlin Publisher: Nature Portfolio Web of Science ID: WOS:001055372500027","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\FWCUWBX8\Lu et al. - 2023 - Rab27a-mediated extracellular vesicle secretion co.pdf","","","DIFFERENTIATION; EXOSOMES; MARROW; REGENERATION; STEM-CELLS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, focusing on practical applying problems, the osteoinductivity of MSC-exos produced by different stem cell sources (rBMSCs/rASCs) and culture conditions (osteoinductive/common) were systematically compared to screen out an optimized osteogenic exosome (BMSCOI-exo). Via bioinformatic analyses by miRNA microarray and in vitro pathway verification by gene silencing and miRNA transfection, we first revealed that the osteoinductivity of BMSC-OI-exo was attributed to multicomponent exosomal miRNAs (let-7a-5p, let-7c-5p, miR-328a-5p and miR-31a-5p). These miRNAs targeted Acvr2b/Acvr1 and regulated the competitive balance of Bmpr2/Acvr2b toward Bmpr-elicited Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation. On these bases, lyophilized delivery of BMSC-OI-exo on hierarchical mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) scaffold was developed to realize bioactivity maintenance and sustained release by entrapment in the surface microporosity of the scaffold. In a rat cranial defect model, the loading of BMSC-OI-exo efficiently enhanced the bone forming capacity of the scaffold and induced rapid initiation of bone regeneration. This paper could provide empirical bases of MSC-exo-based therapy for bone regeneration and theoretical bases of MSC-exoinduced osteogenesis mechanism. The BMSC-OI-exo-loaded MBG scaffold developed here represented a promising bone repairing strategy for future clinical application.","2021-05","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:43","120718","","","272","","Biomaterials","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 20 Place: Oxford Publisher: Elsevier Sci Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000642474200003","","","","","Acvr2b competitive Receptor; ADIPOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; ANGIOGENESIS; Bmpr2; Bone regeneration; Hierarchical scaffold; IN-VITRO; MECHANISM; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; Mesoporous bioactive glass; miRNA; MSC-Derived exosome; OSTEOBLASTS; OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; PROLIFERATION; PROMOTES; TGF-BETA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cell-free tissue regeneration thus has a potential to avoid these problems. Stem cell derived exosomes do not cause immune rejection or generate malignant tumors. Here, exosomes that can induce osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are identified and used to decorate 3D-printed titanium alloy scaffolds to achieve cell-free bone regeneration. Specifically, the exosomes secreted by hMSCs osteogenically pre-differentiated for different times are used to induce the osteogenesis of hMSCs. It is discovered that pre-differentiation for 10 and 15 days leads to the production of osteogenic exosomes. The purified exosomes are then loaded into the scaffolds. It is found that the cell-free exosome-coated scaffolds regenerate bone tissue as efficiently as hMSC-seeded exosome-free scaffolds within 12 weeks. RNA-sequencing suggests that the osteogenic exosomes induce the osteogenic differentiation by using their cargos, including upregulated osteogenic miRNAs (Hsa-miR-146a-5p, Hsa-miR-503-5p, Hsa-miR-483-3p, and Hsa-miR-129-5p) or downregulated anti-osteogenic miRNAs (Hsa-miR-32-5p, Hsa-miR-133a-3p, and Hsa-miR-204-5p), to activate the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. Consequently, identification of osteogenic exosomes secreted by pre-differentiated stem cells and the use of them to replace stem cells represent a novel cell-free bone regeneration strategy.","2020-10","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:43","2001334","","19","7","","Adv.

Understanding how the host and pathogen interact in active TB will have a significant impact on global TB control efforts. Exosomes are increasingly recognized as a means of cell-to-cell contact and exchange of soluble mediators. In the case of TB, exosomes are released from the bacillus and infected cells. In the present study, a comprehensive lipidomics and proteomics analysis of size exclusion chromatography-isolated plasma-derived exosomes from patients with TB lymphadenitis (TBL) and treated as well as untreated pulmonary TB (PTB) was performed to elucidate the possibility to utilize exosomes in diagnostics and knowledge building. According to our findings, exosome-derived lipids and proteins originate from both the host and Mtb in the plasma of active TB patients. Exosomes from all patients are mostly composed of sphingomyelins (SM), phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylinositols, free fatty acids, triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesterylesters. Relative proportions of, e.g., SMs and TAGs, vary depending on the disease or treatment state and could be linked to Mtb pathogenesis and dormancy. We identified three proteins of Mtb origin: DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta (RpoC), Diacyglycerol O-acyltransferase (Rv2285), and Formate hydrogenase (HycE), the latter of which was discovered to be differently expressed in TBL patients. Furthermore, we discovered that Mtb infection alters the host protein composition of circulating exosomes, significantly affecting a total of 37 proteins. All TB patients had low levels of apolipoproteins, as well as the antibacterial proteins cathelicidin, Scavenger Receptor Cysteine Rich Family Member (SSC5D), and Ficolin 3 (FCN3). When compared to healthy controls, the protein profiles of PTB and TBL were substantially linked, with 14 proteins being co-regulated. However, adhesion proteins (integrins, Intercellular adhesion molecule 2 (ICAM2), CD151, Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4)) were shown to be more prevalent in PTB patients, while immunoglobulins, Complement component 1r (C1R), and Glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) were found to be more abundant in TBL patients, respectively. This study could confirm findings from previous reports and uncover novel molecular profiles not previously in focus of TB research. However, we applied a minimally invasive sampling and analysis of circulating exosomes in TB patients. Based on the findings given here, future studies into host-pathogen interactions could pave the way for the development of new vaccines and therapies.","2022-04","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:43","783","","4","10","","Biomedicines","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 21 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000785177900001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\LAM9CFHY\Biadglegne et al. - 2022 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis Affects Protein .pdf","","","ADHESION; BIOMARKERS; exosomes; EXPRESSION; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; GENE; IDENTIFICATION; lipids; MACROPHAGES; MODEL; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; plasma; PLATFORM; proteins; SPHINGOLIPIDS; tuberculosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, osteoinductive growth factors are often removed during preparation, which destroys the osteoinductive capacity of the DBM scaffold. Biomaterials combined with gene therapy is a promising approach to effectively avoid this adverse side effect. This study develops a human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (hBMP2) gene-activated DBM scaffold to enhance the osteoinductive capacity of DBM and improve bone repair. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived microvesicles (MVs) were obtained, and polyethyleneimine (PEI) and human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (hBMP2) plasmids (phBMP2) were sequentially coated on the MVs by layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly to form an MVs-PEI/phBMP2 non-viral gene vector. Finally, the gene-activated scaffold (DBM/MVs-PEI/phBMP2) was prepared by loading MVs-PEI/phBMP2 onto a DBM scaffold. The experimental results show that the MVs-PEI/phBMP2 exhibits higher transfection efficiency and lower cytotoxicity to MSCs when the MVs/PEI weight ratio = 5, and could enhance the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro. Subcutaneous implantation into rats showed that the DBM/MVs-PEI/phBMP2 scaffold could efficiently enhance the deposition of: collagen fibers, osteocalcin, osteopontin and CD34 endogenous proteins. Rabbit femoral condyle defect experiments proved that the DBM/MVs-PEI/phBMP2 scaffold could significantly promote bone repair. This study presents a novel, highly efficient and low cytotoxicity gene delivery vector based on MVs. The geneactivated DBM scaffold based on MVs not only could promote bone formation but also angiogenesis, implying that this kind of gene-activated scaffold is a promising bone substitute material.","2020-08-14","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:43","6378-6389","","30","8","","J.

Current approaches involving cell-based scaffolds or nanoparticle-modified biomimic-ECM have been met with additional biosafety concerns. Herein, the natural biomineralization process is first analyzed and is found that mesenchymal stem cells-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) from early and late stages of osteoinduction play different roles during the mineralization process. The functional EVs hierarchically with blood-derived autohydrogel (AH) are then incorporated to form an osteoinductive biomimetic extracellular matrix (BECM). The alkaline phosphatase-rich EVs are released from the outer layers to induce osteoblast differentiation during early stages. Thereafter, as the degradation of AH occurred, calcium/phosphorus (Ca/P)-rich EVs are liberated to promote the nucleation of extracellular mineral crystals. Additionally, BECM contains considerable collagen fibrils that provide additional nucleation sites for crystallites deposition, thus reaching self-mineralization in situ. In conclusion, this research provides a promising, versatile mineralization-instructive platform to tackle the challenges faced in bone-tissue engineering.","2020-05","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:43","2000015","","21","30","","Adv.

Previous researches have shown that some apoVs, such as those derived from mesenchymal stem cells, contribute to bone formation. However, those apoVs cannot be extracted from patients in large quantities, and cell expansion is needed before apoV isolation, which limits their clinical translation. Mature RBCs, which have no nuclei or genetic material, are easy to obtain, showing high biological safety as a source of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Previous studies have demonstrated that RBC-derived EVs have multiple biological functions, but it is unknown whether RBCs produce apoVs and what effect these apoVs have on bone regeneration. In this study, we isolated and characterized RBC-derived apoVs (RBC-apoVs) from human venous blood and investigated their role in the osteogenesis of human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). We showed that RBCs could produce RBC-apoVs that expressed both general apoVs markers and RBC markers. RBC-apoVs significantly promoted osteogenesis of hBMSCs and enhanced bone regeneration in rat calvarial defects. Mechanistically, RBC-apoVs regulated osteogenesis by transferring carbonic anhydrase 1 (CA1) into hBMSCs and activating the P38 MAPK pathway. Our results indicated that RBC-apoVs could deliver functional molecules from RBCs to hBMSCs and promote bone regeneration, pointing to possible therapeutic use in bone tissue engineering.","2023-09-11","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:44","2024-01-26 18:23:43","e13547","","","","","Cell Prolif.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 17 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:001067460700001","","","","","DEATH; EXOSOMES; OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain ambiguous. In this inquiry, the activation of endogenous neural stem cells in the hippocampus post TBI led to the secretion of extracellular vesicles (NSC-EV) that targeted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, ultimately promoting bone healing. The enrichment of miR-9-5p in NSC-EV facilitated osteogenesis through the activation of the MAP3K3 pathway. We also present a novel hydrogel formulation for clinical application of NSC-EVs by means of ROS-responsive EV delivery. The hydrogel was cross-linked with EVs to create a water-based gel encapsulation, which was applied to a 3D-printed beta-TCP scaffold for controlled long-term release that corresponded to those of physiological bone tissue. Our investigation represents the inaugural usage of EVs derived from neural stem cells in bone tissue engineering. These EVs were found to encourage information exchange between the central nervous system and bone tissue regeneration.

Several approaches can be made to treat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, including the use of stem cells. However, the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells depends on its released factors, including extracellular vesicles. Extracellular vesicles have been recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication as they participate in many physiological processes. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells derived extracellular vesicles on the structure of alveolar bone in rats with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.MethodsThirty adult albino male rats were divided into 3 groups: control group (CG), glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GOG) and extracellular vesicles treated group (ExTG). Rats in the GOG and ExTG groups were injected with methylprednisolone acetate (40 mg/kg) intramuscularly in the quadriceps muscle 3 times per week for three weeks in the early morning. Afterwards, the rats in GOG group received a single vehicle injection (PBS) while each rat in the ExTG group received a single injection of extracellular vesicles (400 mu g/kg suspended in 0.2 ml PBS) in the tail vein. Rats were euthanized 1 month after injection. Mandibles were dissected and the molar segments were prepared for histological preparation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX).ResultsHistology and scanning electron microscopyof bone tissue showed alveolar bone loss and bone resorption in the GOG group. while in the ExTG group, alveolar bone demostrated normal bone architecture. EDX showed that calcium percentage in GOG group was lower than ExTG group,which showed no statistically significant difference from the control group.ConclusionsExtracellular vesicles may be a promising treatment modality in the treatment of bone diseases and in bone regeneration. However, further research is needed before stating that extracellular vesicles s can be used to treat bone disorders especially when translating to humans.","2023-03-17","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:14","205","","1","24","","BMC Musculoskelet.

Considering the aligned architecture of the tendon, inflammatory microenvironment at the injury site, and the need for endogenous cell/tissue infiltration, there is an imminent need for an ideal scaffold to promote TBH that has aligned architecture, ability to modulate inflammation, and macroporous structure. Herein, a novel macroporous hydrogel comprising sodium alginate/hyaluronic acid/small extracellular vesicles from adipose-derived stem cells (sEVs) (MHA-sEVs) with aligned architecture and immunomodulatory ability is fabricated. When implanted subcutaneously, MHA-sEVs significantly improve cell infiltration and tissue integration through its macroporous structure. When applied to the osteoporotic RCR model, MHA-sEVs promote TBH by improving tendon repair through macroporous aligned architecture while enhancing bone regeneration by modulating inflammation. Notably, the biomechanical strength of MHA-sEVs is approximately two times higher than the control group, indicating great potential in reducing postoperative retear rates. Further cell-hydrogel interaction studies reveal that the alignment of microfiber gels in MHA-sEVs induces tenogenic differentiation of tendon-derived stem cells, while sEVs improve mitochondrial dysfunction in M1 macrophages (M phi) and inhibit M phi polarization toward M1 via nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa b) signaling pathway. Taken together, MHA-sEVs provide a promising strategy for future clinical application in promoting osteoporotic TBH.

However, the inherent drawbacks, including limited cell survival after cell transplantation, have hindered direct MSC transplantation for tissue repair and regeneration. The aim of this study was to investigate if exosomes isolated from MSCs can promote the proliferation and differentiation of human primary osteoblastic cells (HOBs) and be potentially used for bone tissue regeneration. We showed that adipose tissue-derived MSC (ASC)-derived exosomes (ASC-EXO) were able to promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in HOBs; and the trophic effects of ASC-EXO on HOBs were further harnessed when ASCs were preconditioned with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) for 3 days, which mimics the acute inflammatory phase upon bone injury. In addition, we showed that Wnt-3a content was elevated in ASC-EXO when ASCs were preconditioned by TNF-alpha, and inhibiting Wnt signaling decreased the osteogenic gene expression levels in HOBs which were cultured in TNF-alpha preconditioned ASCs conditioned medium. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that ASC-EXO, especially primed by TNF-alpha preconditioning on ASCs, offer a promising approach to replace direct stem cell transplantation for bone repair and regeneration.","2017-11","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:15","1212-1220","","21-22","23","","Tissue Eng.

When MSCs are exposed to an inflammatory environment, they release more functional growth factors, exosomes, and chemokines. Herein, MSCs are stimulated to alter sEV cargos and functions to regulate the inflammatory microenvironment and promote tissue regeneration. Sequencing of sEV miRNAs shows that certain RNAs conducive to cell function are upregulated. In this study, in vitro cell function experiments show that both inflammation-stimulated adipose-derived MSC (ADSC)-derived sEV (IAE) and normal ADSC-derived sEV (AE) promote cell proliferation; IAE also significantly improves cell migration. Regarding macrophage polarization regulation, IAE significantly promotes M2 macrophage differentiation. RNA-sequencing analysis indicates that high miR-27b-3p expression levels in IAE may regulate macrophages by targeting macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). In vivo, a rabbit temporomandibular joint (TMJ) condylar osteochondral defect model shows that both AE and IAE promote TMJ regeneration, with IAE having the most significant therapeutic effect. Therefore, the authors confirm that exposing MSCs to an inflammatory environment can feasibly enhance sEV functions and that modified sEVs achieve better therapeutic effects.","2022-04","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:15","2107354","","16","18","","Small","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 15 Place: Weinheim Publisher: Wiley-V C H Verlag Gmbh Web of Science ID: WOS:000767632700001","","","","","BONE; CYTOKINES; DIFFERENTIATION; EXOSOMES; extracellular vesicles; IMMUNOSUPPRESSION; inflammation; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; MICRORNA; miR-27b-3p; POLARIZATION; regeneration; STROMAL CELLS; temporomandibular joint; TISSUE-REPAIR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we investigated the proangiogenic effects of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by P-DPSCs using in vitro and in vivo testing models. Methods Patient-matched DPSCs derived from periodontally healthy teeth (H-DPSCs) were used as the control for P-DPSCs. Conditioned media (CMs) derived from H-DPSCs and P-DPSCs (H-CM and P-CM), CMs derived from both cell types pretreated with the EV secretion blocker GW4869 (H-GW and P-GW), and EVs secreted by H-DPSCs and P-DPSCs (H-EVs and P-EVs) were prepared to test their proangiogenic effects on endothelial cells (ECs). Cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation were assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell/scratch wound healing, and Matrigel assays, respectively. Specifically, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis were used to examine the expression levels of angiogenesis-related genes/proteins in ECs in response to EV-based incubation. Finally, a full-thickness skin defect model was applied to test the effects of EVs on wound healing and new vessel formation. Results Both H-CM and P-CM promoted EC angiogenesis, but the proangiogenic effects were compromised when ECs were incubated in H-GW and P-GW, wherein the EV secretion was blocked by pretreatment with GW4869. In EV-based incubations, although both H-EVs and P-EVs were found to enhance the angiogenesis-related activities of ECs, P-EVs exerted a more robust potential to stimulate EC proliferation, migration, and tube formation. In addition, P-EVs led to higher expression levels of angiogenesis-related genes/proteins in ECs than H-EVs. Similarly, both P-EVs and H-EVs were found to accelerate wound healing and promote vascularization across skin defects in mice, but wounds treated with P-EVs resulted in a quicker healing outcome and enhanced new vessel formation. Conclusions The findings of the present study provide additional evidence that P-DPSCs derived from periodontally diseased teeth represent a potential source of cells for research and therapeutic use. Particularly, the proangiogenic effects of P-EVs suggest that P-DPSCs may be used to promote new vessel formation in cellular therapy and regenerative medicine.","2020-03-06","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:15","110","","1","11","","Stem Cell Res.

BMSCs and Exos are successfully obtained. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that HDAC4 (Histone deacetylase 4) is inhibited by miR-29a overexpression accompanied by the upregulation of RUNX2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2) and VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor), thereby enhancing osteogenic and angiogenic capabilities. The HMP@Exo system is synthesized from HB-PEGDA (Hyperbranched Poly Ethylene Glycol Diacrylate)- and SH-HA (Sulfhydryl-Modified Hyaluronic Acid)-containing Exos using a microfluidic technique. The HMP surface is modified with RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptides to enhance cell adhesion. The system demonstrated good injectability, remarkable compatibility, outstanding cell adhesion properties, and slow degradation capacity, and the sustained release of Agomir-29a-Exos (Exosomes derived from Agomir-29a transfected BMSCs) from HMPs enhanced the proliferation and migration of BMSCs and HUVECs (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) while promoting osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the HMP@Exo system can effectively maintain the activity and half-life of Exos, accompanied by overexpression of miR-29a (microRNA-29a). The injectable system provides an innovative approach for accelerating fracture healing by coupling osteogenesis and angiogenesis. HMP@Exo is prepared by HB-PEGDA and SH-HA through Michael addition reaction using microfluidic technology. To promote bone repair, HMPs are utilized to encapsulate miR-29a-abundant Exos, meanwhile, surface of the HMPs is modified with RGD peptides.

Sympatho-adrenergic activation is implicated in stress-induced depression and leads to bone loss, but the mechanisms and therapeutics are incompletely elucidated. Here, it is revealed that sympathetic neurostress through the beta(1/2)-adrenergic receptor (beta 1/2-AR) signaling triggers the transcription response of a microRNA, miR-21, in osteoblasts, which is transferred to osteoclast progenitors via exosomes for dictating osteoclastogenesis. After confirming that miR-21 deficiency retards the beta 1/2-AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO)-induced osteopenia, it is shown that the pharmacological inhibition of exosome release by two clinically-relevant drugs, dimethyl amiloride and omeprazole, suppresses osteoblastic miR-21 transfer and ameliorates bone loss under both ISO and chronic variable stress (CVS)-induced depression conditions. A targeted delivery approach to specifically silence osteoblastic miR-21 is further applied, which is effective in rescuing the bone remodeling balance and ameliorating ISO- and CVS-induced osteopenias. These results decipher a previously unrecognized paradigm that neural cues drive exosomal microRNA communication to regulate organ homeostasis and help to establish feasible strategies to counteract bone loss under psychological stresses.","2022-03","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:15","2100763","","3","6","","Small Methods","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 16 Place: Weinheim Publisher: Wiley-V C H Verlag Gmbh Web of Science ID: WOS:000730735500001","","","","","ADIPOCYTE; bones; DELIVERY; depression; exosome; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; MASS; MECHANISM; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; microRNA; OSTEOGENESIS; PREVENTS; SUPPRESSION; sympathetic nervous system; SYSTEM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No differences in growth or survival of 4T1 murine breast cancer cells were detected at a concentration of 50 mu M of enoxacin or bis-enoxacin. Growth was perturbed at higher concentrations. Both 50 mu M enoxacin and bis-enoxacin stimulated increases in the number of GW/Processing bodies, but there were minimal changes in microRNA levels. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from 4T1 cells treated with 50 mu M enoxacin or 50 mu M bis-enoxacin stimulated proliferation of RAW 264.7 cells, and both significantly inhibited osteoclastogenesis in calcitriol-stimulated mouse marrow. EVs from 4T1 cells treated with enoxacin and bis-enoxacin displayed small reductions in the amount of microRNA (miR)-146a-5p and let-7b-5p. In marked contrast, miR-214-3p, which has been shown to regulate bone remodeling, was increased 22-fold and 30-fold respectively.

In experimental colitis mouse models established by dextran sulfate sodium and IL-10 knockout induced with piroxicam, bone mass and quality are significantly decreased. Colitis mice demonstrate a lower bone formation rate and fewer osteoblasts in femur. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BMSCs) from colitis mice tend to differentiate into adipocytes rather than osteoblasts. Serum from patients with IBD promotes adipogenesis of human BMSCs. RNA sequencing reveals that colitis downregulates Wnt signaling in BMSCs. For treatment, exosomes with Golgi glycoprotein 1 inserted could carry Wnt agonist 1 and accumulate in bone via intravenous adminis-tration. They could alleviate bone loss, promote bone formation, and accelerate fracture healing in colitis mice.

The characteristics of the two types of exosomes were not significantly different. Compared to MSCs-Exos, iPSCs-Exos had a better in vitro effect on the proliferation, migration, cell cycle promotion and apoptosis inhibition of human corneal epithelial cells. iPSCs/MSCs-Exos promoted cell regeneration by upregulating cyclin A and CDK2 to drive HCECs to enter the S phase from the G0/G1 phase.

Bone microdamage is mainly caused by processes such as enhancing osteoclast activity or reducing bone formation by osteoblast-lineage cells. Compared with young individuals, extracellular vesicles derived from senescent bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells(BMSCs) increase the transient differentiation of bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) to osteoclasts, ultimately leading to osteoporosis and metal implant failure. To address this daunting problem, an exosome-targeted orthopedic implant composed of a nutrient coating was developed. A high-zinc atmosphere used as a local microenvironmental cue not only could inhibit the bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclasts but also could induce the reprogramming of senile osteogenesis and osteoclast dialogue by exosome modification. Bidirectional regulation of intercellular communication via cargoes, including microRNAs carried by exosomes, was detected. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrated that the key regulator miR-146b-5p regulates the protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway by targeting the catalytic subunit gene of PI3K-PIK3CB. In vivo evaluation using a naturally-aged osteoporotic rat femoral defect model further confirmed that a nutrient coating substantially augments cancellous bone remodeling and osseointegration by regulating local BMMs differentiation. Altogether, this study not only reveals the close link between senescent stem cell communication and age-related osteoporosis but also provides a novel orthopedic implant for elderly patients with exosome modulation capability.","2023-09-23","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:16","346","","1","21","","J.

Recent studies have shown that exosomes derived from osteoclasts could mediate cell-to-cell communication in bone remodeling. However, the role of osteoclast-derived exosomes in bone remodeling in microgravity remains a mystery. Our objective is to investigate the cellular processes modulated by exosomes from RAW264.7 cell-derived osteoclasts and the underlying mechanism of action for the exosomes-mediated osteogenesis of osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells in simulated microgravity. We took advantage of the random positioning machine (RPM) to simulate microgravity for the model and investigated the role of exosomes from RAW264.7 cell-derived osteoclasts in osteoclast-osteoblast communication. The results showed that this type of mature osteoclast-derived exosomes (OC-Exos) in the RPM evidently inhibited the cellular proliferation of osteoblasts via inducing cellular apoptosis and altering their cell cycle distribution. Alkaline phosphatase and mineralization activity of MC3T3-E1 cells were significantly lower after treatment with OC-Exos from RPM and mRNA expression of osteoblast-specific genes were down-regulated. Further study confirmed that OC-Exos in RPM obstructed the differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells by interfering with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Together, these observations demonstrated that OC-Exos played an essential role in the regulation of bone remodeling in the microgravity environment. These results shed light on a novel pathway of cross-talk between osteoclasts and osteoblasts, which will be helpful to explain the possible mechanisms underlying osteoporosis in microgravity.","2019-01","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:16","140-152","","","154","","Acta Astronaut.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 13 Place: Oxford Publisher: Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000454377500015","","","","","ACTIVATION; BONE; Bone remodeling; CELLS; CROSS-TALK; Exosomes; EXPRESSION; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; INTERCELLULAR COMMUNICATION; Microgravity; OSTEOBLAST; Osteoblasts; Osteoclasts; SPACEFLIGHT; WEIGHTLESSNESS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are nano-sized extracellular vesicles, which play an important role in tissue engineering in recent years. The primary focus of this study was to develop a bioactive 3D PLA scaffold using exosome-based strategy to improve its osteogenic and immunoregulatory potential. We firstly successfully isolated MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-Exo). Morphological analysis revealed that MSC-Exo exhibits a typical cup-shaped morphology with high expression of exosomal marker CD63. MSC-Exo internalization into recipient cells were also investigated using flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Porous 3D PLA scaffold coated MSC-Exo were used for immunoregulatory and osteogenic testing. Exosomes released from 3D PLA scaffold were validated in RAW264.7 and hBMSCs. The cell proliferation and live/dead assay indicated high biocompatibility for PLA-Exo scaffold. Additionally, PLA-Exo scaffold could reduce the pro-inflammatory marker expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, indicating potential immunoregulatory potential. It is also confirmed that PLA-Exo scaffold could potentiate osteogenic differentiation in the osteogenesis assay. In conclusion, our results demonstrate this bioactive 3D-printed PLA scaffolds with MSC-Exo modification holds immunoregulatory potential and favor osteogenic differentiation, thus having potential applications in bone tissue regeneration.","2022-08-22","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:16","22","","1","16","","J.

However, the lack of standard procedures and controls leads to high variability in the obtained results, limiting their regular clinical use. Here, we propose the use of platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as an off-the-shelf alternative for PRP and PL for bone regeneration. In this article, we evaluate the effect of PL-derived EVs on the biocompatibility and differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Methods EVs were obtained first by ultracentrifugation (UC) and then by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) from non-activated PL. EVs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and the expression of CD9 and CD63 markers by western blot. The effect of the obtained EVs on osteoinduction was evaluated in vitro on human umbilical cord MSCs by messenger RNA (mRNA) expression analysis of bone markers, alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), and calcium (Ca2+) content. Results Osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was confirmed when treated with UC-isolated EVs. In order to disprove that the effect was due to co-isolated proteins, EVs were isolated by SEC. Purer EVs were obtained and proved to maintain the differentiation effect on MSCs and showed a dose-dependent response. Conclusion PL-derived EVs present an osteogenic capability comparable to PL treatments, emerging as an alternative able to overcome PL and PRP limitations.","2020-10","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:16","667-674","","10","9","","Bone Jt.

Enhancing osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs is a feasible therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis. Here, bone marrow stromal cell (ST)-derived exosomes (STExos) are found to remarkably enhance osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. However, intravenous injection of STExos is inefficient in ameliorating osteoporotic phenotypes in an ovariectomy (OVX)-induced postmenopausal osteoporosis mouse model, which may be because STExos are predominantly accumulated in the liver and lungs, but not in bone. Hereby, the STExo surface is conjugated with a BMSC-specific aptamer, which delivers STExos into BMSCs within bone marrow. Intravenous injection of the STExo-Aptamer complex enhances bone mass in OVX mice and accelerates bone healing in a femur fracture mouse model. These results demonstrate the efficiency of BMSC-specific aptamer-functionalized STExos in targeting bone to promote bone regeneration, providing a novel promising approach for the treatment of osteoporosis and fracture.","2019-11-21","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:16","20884-20892","","43","11","","Nanoscale","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 9 Place: Cambridge Publisher: Royal Soc Chemistry Web of Science ID: WOS:000502779900050","","","","","ANGIOGENESIS; BIODISTRIBUTION; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; GROWTH; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; MICROENVIRONMENT; REPAIR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gene expression analyses along with epigenetic and morphological tests were carried out to examine odontogenic and osteogenic differentiation and cell proliferation. Compressive testing of the grafting materials seeded with DPSCs was performed as well. DPSC differentiation into odontoblast-like cells was identified from the upregulation of odontogenic markers (DSPP and MSX) and osteogenic markers (RUNX2, alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin, osteocalcin, collagen type I, bmp2, smad5/8). Epigenetic tests confirmed the presence of miRNAs involved in odontogenic or osteogenic commitment of DPSCs cultured for up to 21 days on DP. Compressive strength values obtained from extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesized by DPSCs showed a trend of being higher when seeded onto DP than onto BG. High expression of VEGF factor, which is related to angiogenesis, and of dentin sialoprotein was observed only in the presence of DP. Morphological analyses confirmed the typical phenotype of adult odontoblasts. In conclusion, the odontogenic and osteogenic commitment of DPSCs and their respective functions can be achieved on DP, which enables exceptional dentin and bone regeneration.","2022-08","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:17","9283","","16","23","","Int.

Osteoblasts are the main cells responsible for bone formation in vivo and directing ADSCs to form osteoblasts through osteogenesis is a research topic in BTE. In addition to the osteogenesis of ADSCs into osteoblasts, the crosstalk of ADSCs with osteoblasts through the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) may also contribute to bone formation in ADSC-based BTE. We investigated the effect of ADSC-secreted EVs (ADSC-EVs) on osteoblast function. ADSC-EVs (size <= 1000 nm) were isolated from the culture supernatant of ADSCs through ultracentrifugation. The ADSC-EVs were observed to be spherical under a transmission electron microscope. The ADSC-EVs were positive for CD9, CD81, and Alix, but beta-actin was not detected. ADSC-EV treatment did not change survival but did increase osteoblast proliferation and activity. The 48 most abundant known microRNAs (miRNAs) identified within the ADSC-EVs were selected and then subjected to gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. The GO analysis revealed that these miRNAs are highly relevant to skeletal system morphogenesis and bone development. The KEGG analysis indicated that these miRNAs may regulate osteoblast function through autophagy or the mitogen-activated protein kinase or Ras-related protein 1 signaling pathway. These results suggest that ADSC-EVs enhance osteoblast function and can contribute to bone regeneration in ADSC-based BTE.","2022-07","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:17","1752","","7","10","","Biomedicines","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 22 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000831942800001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\RKKAWNJR\Ho et al. - 2022 - Enhancement of Osteoblast Function through Extrace.pdf","","","adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs); bone tissue engineering (BTE); BONE-FORMATION; DIFFERENTIATION; EXOSOMES; extracellular vesicles (EVs); GENE-EXPRESSION; MECHANISM; MEMBRANE-VESICLES; microRNA (miRNA); MICROVESICLES; MINERALIZATION; osteoblast function; STRATEGIES; THERAPIES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the applications of exosomes have been hindered by limited sources and insufficient therapeutic potency. Results: In this study, a stem cell-mediated gene therapy strategy is developed in which mediator mesenchymal stem cells are genetically engineered by bone morphogenetic protein-2 gene to produce exosomes (MSC-BMP2-Exo) with enhanced bone regeneration potency. This effect is attributed to the synergistic effect of the content derived from MSCs and the up-regulated BMP2 gene expression. The MSC-BMP2-Exo also present homing ability to the injured site. The toxic effect of genetical transfection vehicles is borne by mediator MSCs, while the produced exosomes exhibit excellent biocompatibility. In addition, by plasmid tracking, it is interesting to find a portion of plasmid DNA can be encapsulated by exosomes and delivered to recipient cells. Conclusions: In this strategy, engineered MSCs function as cellular factories, which effectively produce exosomes with designed and enhanced therapeutic effects. The accelerating effect in bone healing and the good biocompatibility suggest the potential clinical application of this strategy.","2022-03-15","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:17","135","","1","20","","J.

The small intestinal submucosa (SIS) membrane possesses a precise spatial structure with excellent biocompatibility. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells can achieve rapid cell proliferation and migration with little immune response by creating a satisfactory microenvironment. In this study, fusion peptide-mediated EVs are able to modify the surface of the SIS membrane via specific combination. In vitro studies prove that modified SIS membranes can promote cell migration and spreading. This phenomenon may be because of the activation of TEADs, which regulate cell behavior. By constructing a rat abdominal wall defect model, it is further demonstrated that the modified SIS membrane is more conducive to tissue regeneration. Collectively, these results suggest that SIS membranes modified by fusion peptide-mediated EVs achieve excellent biofunction and provide promising prospects for tissue regeneration.","2021-11","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:17","2101298","","22","10","","Adv.

Histological examination of rats implanted with 3D-PLA/hGMSCs/EVs evidenced the activation of bone regeneration and of the vascularization process, confirmed also by MicroCT. In synthesis, an upregulation of miR-2861 and -210 other than RUNX2, VEGFA, OPN and COL1A1 was evident in cells cultured in the presence of the biomaterial and EVs. Then, these results evidenced that EVs may enhance bone regeneration in calvaria defects, in association with an enhanced vascularization offering a novel regulatory system in the osteoangiogenesis evolution. The application of new strategies to improve biomaterial engraftment is of great interest in the regenerative medicine and can represent a way to promote bone regeneration.","2019-07-01","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:17","3256","","13","20","","Int.

However, poor yield for the production technique and unexpected therapeutic efficacy of exosomes have been obstacles to their widespread use in clinical practices. Here, we report an alternative strategy to produce exosome-related vesicles with high yields and improved regenerative capability. An extrusion approach was employed to amass exosome mimetics (EMs) from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The collected EMs had a significantly increased proportion of vesicles positive for the exosome-specific CD-63 marker compared with MSC-derived exosomes. EMs were further obtained from genetically modified hMSCs in which expression of noggin, a natural bone morphogenetic protein antagonist, was down-regulated to enhance osteogenic properties of EMs. Moreover, the administration of hMSC-EMs in conjunction with an injectable chitosan hydrogel into mouse nonhealing calvarial defects demonstrated robust bone regeneration. Importantly, mechanistic studies revealed that the enhanced osteogenesis by EMs in which noggin was suppressed was mediated via inhibition of miR-29a. These findings demonstrate the great promise of MSC-mediated EMs and modulation of small RNA signaling for skeletal regeneration and cell-free therapy.","2020-09-22","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:17","11973-11984","","9","14","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 12 Place: Washington Publisher: Amer Chemical Soc Web of Science ID: WOS:000615915300004","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\64Y3C8ER\Fan et al. - 2020 - Generation of Small RNA-Modulated Exosome Mimetics.pdf","","","bone; exosome mimetics; MSCs; noggin suppression; sRNAs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies exploring the short external rotator sparing approach are rare. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of standard posterior approach and short external rotator sparing approach.MethodsThis prospective observational study included 126 patients who underwent THA in June 2017-June 2018. Patients were assigned to standard (standard posterior approach) and corrective (short external rotator sparing approach) groups based on the surgical method. Surgical data were recorded postoperatively. Postoperative hip joint recovery was assessed using the times to ambulation and independent stair use, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, Harris score, and Oxford hip score (OHS) at 2 and 8 postoperative weeks. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used for postoperative pain assessment.ResultsPostoperative changes of creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin, CRP, and prosthesis position were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). However, intraoperative blood loss (P < 0.001) and postoperative 6-h drainage volume (P = 0.03), hospital stay, blood transfusion rate, and times to ambulation and independent stair use were significantly reduced in the corrective group. Postoperatively, Oxford, and WOMAC scores significantly decreased in both groups. After surgery, the VAS score was more overtly decreased in the corrective group compared with the standard group.ConclusionsThis study concluded that the less invasive short external rotator sparing approach for THA caused less damage, reducing perioperative blood loss, shortening functional recovery time, maintaining prosthesis stability, and improving postoperative pain.","2021-01-11","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:18","46","","1","16","","J.

Herein, an extracellular vesicles (EVs)-cloaked enzymatic nanohybrid (ENEV) was constructed to serve as a multifaceted biocatalyst for ultrasound (US)-augmented tendon matrix reconstruction and immune microenvironment regulation. The ENEV-based biocatalyst exhibits integrated merits for treating tendon injury, including the efficient catalase-mimetic scavenging of ROS in the injured tissue, sustainable release of Zn2+ ions, cellular uptake augmented by US, and immunoregulation induced by EVs. Our study suggests that ENEVs can promote tenocyte proliferation and type-I collagen synthesis at an early stage by protecting tenocytes from ROS attack. The ENEVs also prompted efficient immune regulation, as the polarization of macrophages (Mf) was reversed from M1f to M2f. In a rat Achilles tendon defect model, the ENEVs combined with US treatment significantly promoted functional recovery and matrix reconstruction, restored tendon morphology, suppressed intratendinous scarring, and inhibited peritendinous adhesion. Overall, this study offers an efficient nanomedicine for US-augmented tendon regeneration with improved healing outcomes and provides an alternative strategy to design multifaceted artificial biocatalysts for synergetic tissue regenerative therapies.","2023-08-24","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:18","16501-16516","","17","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 16 Place: Washington Publisher: Amer Chemical Soc Web of Science ID: WOS:001063558400001","","","","","anti-inflammatory and tissueregeneration; biocatalytic therapies; BIOLOGY; ENHANCE; extracellular vesicles; III COLLAGEN; LIGHT; MACROPHAGE; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; MICROBUBBLES; nanomedicines; TENDINOPATHY; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have been considered as a potentially promising treatment for osteoporosis. However, the therapeutic effect, genetic alterations, and in vivo behavior of exogenous EVs for osteoporosis in mice models remain poorly understood. Methods: A multiplexed molecular imaging strategy was constructed by micro-positron emission tomography (mu PET)/computed tomography (CT), mu CT, and optical imaging modality which reflected the osteoblastic activity, microstructure, and in vivo behavior of EVs, respectively. RNA sequencing was used to analyze the cargo of EVs, and the bone tissues of ovariectomized (OVX) mice post EV treatment. Results: The result of [F-18]NaF mu PET showed an increase in osteoblastic activity in the distal femur of EV-treated mice, and the bone structural parameters derived from mu CT were also improved. In terms of in vivo behavior of exogenous EVs, fluorescent dye-labeled EVs could target the distal femur of mice, whereas the uptakes of bone tissues were not significantly different between OVX mice and healthy mice. RNA sequencing demonstrated upregulation of ECM related genes, which might associate with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, in line with the results of microRNA analysis showing that mir-21, mir-29, mir-221, and let-7a were enriched in Wharton's jelly-MSC-EVs and correlated to the BMP and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Conclusion: The therapeutic effect of exogenous WJ-MSC-EVs in the treatment of osteoporosis was successfully assessed by a multiplexed molecular imaging strategy. The RNA sequencing demonstrated the possible molecular targets in the regulation of bone remodeling. The results highlight the novelty of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of EV-based treatment for osteoporosis.","2021","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:18","7813-7830","","","16","","Int.

This study represents the feasibility study for the sterile production of coprinted scaffolds and the proof of concept for their in vitro biological efficacy. Sterile scaffolds were obtained, and Lyosecretome enhanced their colonization by MSCs, sustaining differentiation towards the bone line in an osteogenic medium. Indeed, after 14 days, the amount of mineralized matrix detected by alizarin red was significantly higher for the Lyosecretome scaffolds. The amount of osteocalcin, a specific bone matrix protein, was significantly higher at all the times considered (14 and 28 days) for the Lyosecretome scaffolds. Confocal microscopy further confirmed such results, demonstrating improved osteogenesis with the Lyosecretome scaffolds after 14 and 28 days.

However, the modification efficiency is not satisfied yet, resulting in compromised therapy effects. Here, we report a novel immobilized method by self-assembling biotinylated MSCEVs onto the surface of biotin-doped polypyrrole titanium (Bio-Ppy-Ti) to improve its biofunctions in vitro and in vivo. Using this method, the amount of human adipose derived stem cell-EVs (hASC-EVs) anchored onto the Bio-Ppy-Ti surface was 185-fold higher than that of pure Ti after ultrasonic concussion for 30 s and it remained stable on the Bio-Ppy-Ti surface for 14 days at 4 degrees C. Compared to pristine Ti, EV-Bio-Ppy-Ti exhibited enhanced cell compatibility and osteoinductivity for osteoblasts in vitro and antiapoptosis ability in the ectopic bone formation mode. Gene chip analysis further demonstrated that several osteoinductive miRNAs were encapsulated in hASC-EVs, which may explain the high bone regeneration ability of EV-Bio-Ppy-Ti. Thus, this MSC-EV biotin-immobilized method appears to be highly efficient and long-term stable for demonstrating its potential for clinical metal implants.","2019-12-11","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:18","46183-46196","","49","11","","ACS Appl.

The modulatory effects of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) on macrophages have encouraged the functionalization of scaffolds through the integration of the exosomes from the BMP2-stimulated macrophages to avoid ectopic bone formation and reduce adverse effects. To determine the functionality of exosomal nanocarriers from macrophages after BMP2 stimulation, we isolated the exosomes from Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)- or BMP2-stimulated macrophages and evaluated their effects on osteogenesis. Morphological characterization of the exosomes derived from DMEM- or BMP2-treated macrophages revealed no significant differences, and the bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells showed similar cellular uptake patterns for both exosomes. In vitro study using BMP2/macrophage-derived exosomes indicated their beneficial effects on osteogenic differentiation. To improve the bio-functionality for titanium implants, BMP2/macrophage-derived exosomes were used to modify titanium nanotube implants to favor osteogenesis. The incorporation of BMP2/macrophage-derived exosomes dramatically increased the expression of early osteoblastic differentiation markers, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and BMP2, indicative of the pro-osteogenic role of the titanium nanotubes incorporated with BMP2/macrophage-derived exosomes. The titanium nanotubes functionalized with BMP2/macrophage-derived exosomes activated autophagy during osteogenic differentiation. In conclusion, the exosome-integrated titanium nanotube may serve as an emerging functional material for bone regeneration. Statement of Significance The clinical application of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) is often limited by its side effects. Exosomes are naturally secreted nanosized vesicles derived from cells and play an important role in intercellular communication. The contributions of this study include (1) the demonstration of the potential regulatory role of BMP2/macrophage-derived exosomes on the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs); (2) fabrication of titanium nanotubes incorporated with exosomes; (3) new insights into the application of titanium nanotube-based materials for the safe use of BMP2.

The paucity of simple, activatable, biologically relevant models of osteoclast-osteoblast coordination has hindered our understanding of how skel-etal remolding is regulated. Here, we describe an inducible ex vivo model of oste-oclast-osteoblast progenitor coordination. Induction activates the release of osteoclastogenic factors from osteoprogenitors, which elicits the differentiation and fusion of neighboring preosteoclasts. In turn, multinucleated osteoclasts release soluble coupling factors, RANK(+) extracellular vesicles and promote os-teoprogenitor proliferation, recapitulating aspects of perturbed coordination in diseases underpinned by excessive osteoclast formation. We expect this model to expedite the investigation of cell-cell fusion, osteoclast-osteoblast progenitor coordination, and extracellular vesicle signaling during bone remodeling and offer a powerful tool for evaluating signaling cascades and novel therapeutic interventions in osteoclast-linked skeletal disease.","2023-04-21","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:18","106470","","4","26","","iScience","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 19 Place: Cambridge Publisher: Cell Press Web of Science ID: WOS:000996773000001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\8U9HGEY5\Whitlock et al. - 2023 - An inducible explant model of osteoclast-osteoprog.pdf","","","BONE; DIFFERENTIATION; EXPRESSION; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; FIBROUS DYSPLASIA; IN-VITRO; INTERLEUKIN-6; MACROPHAGES; OSTEOBLASTIC CELLS; SURFACE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our study aimed to investigate the effect of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) overexpressing glycoprotein non-melanoma clone B (GPNMB) on osteoporosis (OP). Main methods: Lentiviral vector for GPNMB overexpression or its negative control was generated and transfected into BMSCs. EVs enriched with GPNMB (GPNMB-EVs) were extracted from GPNMB-modified BMSC-conditioned medium and then identified. Cellular uptake and proliferation were analyzed using the Dil-labeled assay and CCK-8 assay, respectively. Cytochemical staining, western blot, and RT-qPCR analysis were performed to assess the effect of GPNMB-EVs on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) as the inhibitor was applied to explore the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway involved in the GPNMB-EV-induced osteogenic differentiation. In vivo experiments were conducted using an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and then assessed the effect of GPNMB-EVs by micro-CT, and histological and immunohistochemical assays. Key findings: GPNMB-EVs were taken up by BMSCs, and they noticeably promoted the proliferation of BMSCs. Additionally, GPNMB-EVs activated the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling to stimulate osteogenesis in BMSCs. In vivo examination showed that GPNMB-EVs remarkably improved trabecular bone regeneration and alleviated the osteoporotic phenotype in the OVX-induced rat model of OP. Significance: EVs derived from GPNMB-modified BMSCs significantly stimulated the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and attenuated the bone loss in the OVX-induced rat model of OP. Our findings suggest the promising potential of GPNMB-EVs as cell-free therapy for the treatment of OP.","2021-05-01","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:18","119208","","","272","","Life Sci.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 15 Place: Oxford Publisher: Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000628911100014","","","","","Extracellular vesicles; FEMORAL-HEAD; FORMATION IN-VIVO; Glycoprotein non-melanoma clone B; Mesenchymal stem cells; OSTEOACTIVIN; OSTEOBLAST DIFFERENTIATION; Osteogenesis; Osteoporosis; OSTEOPOROSIS; PREVENTION; REGENERATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, one major problem for stem cell-derived exosome therapies is identifying appropriate source cells. In the present study, we aimed to compare the bone regenerative effect of exosomes secreted by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) derived from type 1 diabetes rats (dBMSC-exos) and exosomes secreted by BMSCs derived from normal rats (nBMSC-exos). BMSCs were isolated from rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and normal rats. dBMSC-exos and nBMSC-exos were isolated by an ultracentrifugation method and identified. The effects of dBMSC-exos and nBMSC-exos on the proliferation and migration of BMSCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were investigated. The effects of exosomes on the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and the angiogenic activity of HUVECs were compared. Finally, a rat calvarial defect model was used to compare the effects of exosomes on bone regeneration and neovascularization in vivo. In vitro, dBMSC-exos and nBMSC-exos both enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and promoted the angiogenic activity of HUVECs, but nBMSC-exos had a greater effect than dBMSC-exos. Similarly, in vivo, both dBMSC-exos and nBMSC-exos promoted bone regeneration and neovascularization in rat calvarial defects, but the therapeutic effect of nBMSC-exos was superior to that of dBMSC-exos. The present study demonstrates for the first time that the bone regenerative effect of exosomes derived from BMSCs is impaired in type 1 diabetes, indicating that for patients with type 1 diabetes, the autologous transplantation of BMSC-exos to promote bone regeneration may be inappropriate.

BMSC-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched with microRNAs (miRs) have vital roles to play in mediating osteogenic differentiation. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effect of BMSC-derived EVs loaded with miR-15b on osteogenic differentiation. Methods Human BMSCs (hBMSCs) were cultured and treated with plasmids overexpressing or knocking down KLF2, WWP1, and miR-15b to define the role of derived EVs in osteogenic differentiation in vitro. The expression of osteogenic differentiation-related marker was measured by Western blot analysis. The interaction among miR-15b, WWP1, and ubiquitination of KLF2 was investigated by dual-luciferase reporter, immunoprecipitation, and GST pull-down assays. Moreover, EVs from hBMSCs transfected with miR-15b inhibitor (EV-miR-15b inhibitor) were injected into ovariectomized rats to verify the effect of miR-15b on bone loss in vivo. Results WWP1 was downregulated, and KLF2 was upregulated during osteogenic differentiation. After co-culture with EVs, miR-15b expression was elevated and WWP1 expression was reduced in hBMSCs. Upregulation of miR-15b or KLF2 or downregulation of WWP1 or NF-kappa B increased ALP activity and cell mineralization, as well as osteogenic differentiation-related marker expression in hBMSCs. Mechanistically, miR-15b targeted and inhibited WWP1, thus attenuating KLF2 degradation and inhibiting NF-kappa B activity. Co-culture of EVs increased the bone volume and trabecular number, but decreased bone loss in ovariectomized rats, which could be reversed after treatment with EV-miR-15b inhibitor. Conclusion Collectively, BMSC-derived EVs loaded with miR-15b promoted osteogenic differentiation by impairing WWP1-mediated KLF2 ubiquitination and inactivating the NF-kappa B signaling pathway.","2020-11-16","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:18","269","","1","22","","Arthritis Res.

Apart from the conventionally controlled release of bioactive molecules, some other exosome roles should be further explored. Herein, we report to construct a specifically gene-activated engineered exosome that not only can effectively modulate the gene release of the vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165), but also can play a pivotal role in enhancing therapy in vascular bone regeneration. Our findings revealed that the transfection efficiency of the VEGF165 plasmid gene was extremely elevated via the exosome-based vector. Both alone exosomes and engineered exosomes exhibited a certain osteoblastic differentiation of precursor cells (MC3T3-E1) in vitro. More importantly, the engineered exosomes that internalized the VEGF165 gene combined with electrospun nanofiber films played a dual role in osteogenesis and angiogenesis based on the evaluation of a rat critical-sized calvarial defect model in vivo.

Stem cell-derived exosomes are emerging as promising therapeutical approaches to treat diverse aging-related osseous diseases. Herein, a previously reported osteoinductive exosome (OI-exo) was applied as a therapeutic agent for bone repair in aging individuals and its internalization mechanisms in senescent bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) were explored. The results demonstrated that OI-exos derived from young BMSCs could partially rescue the proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and alleviate aging phenotypes in vitro. OI-exo-delivered hierarchical mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) scaffold effectively promote in vivo bone formation in aging rat cranial defect model. However, the osteogenic effects of OI-exo both in vitro and in vivo were compromised in senescent individuals and for aging BMSCs compared to younger ones. This study revealed that non-senescent BMSCs internalized exosomes exclusively via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while senescent BMSCs additionally evoked macropinocytosis and caveolae-mediated endocytosis to mediate the internalization of exosomes. The alteration of endocytic manner of senescent BMSCs and the involvement of macropinocytosis might be responsible for the compromised effects of therapeutical exosomes. The phenomena discovered in this study could also be extended to other scenarios where drugs or treatments exerted compromised effects in aging individuals. The influence of endocytic manner, avoidance of macropinocytosis-related negative effects should be taken into considerations in future therapeutic design for aging populations.","2023-01-04","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:19","1090914","","","10","","Front.

A third major cell type in the bone is osteocytes, which are embedded in the matrix, are well-connected to the lacunar network, and are believed to act as mechanical sensors. Here, it is reported that sympathetic innervation directly regulates lacunar osteocyte-mediated bone resorption inside cortical bone. It is found that sympathetic activity is elevated in different mouse models of bone loss, including lactation, ovariectomy, and glucocorticoid treatment. Further, during lactation elevated sympathetic outflow induces netrin-1 expression by osteocytes to further promote sympathetic nerve sprouting in the cortical bone endosteum in a feed-forward loop. Depletion of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) sympathetic nerves ameliorated osteocyte-mediated perilacunar bone resorption in lactating mice. Moreover, norepinephrine activates beta-adrenergic receptor 2 (Adrb2) signaling to promote secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing bone-degrading enzymes for perilacunar bone resorption and inhibit osteoblast differentiation. Importantly, osteocyte-specific deletion of Adrb2 or treatment with a beta-blocker results in lower bone resorption in lactating mice. Together, these findings show that the sympathetic nervous system promotes osteocyte-driven bone loss during lactation, likely as an adaptive response to the increased energy and mineral demands of the nursing mother.","2023-06","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:19","","","18","10","","Adv.

Current therapeutic agents aim to inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption but only have palliative effects. During normal bone remodeling, the balance between bone resorption and osteoblast-mediated bone formation is essential for bone homeostasis. One major function of osteoblast during bone formation is to secrete type I procollagen, which will then be processed before being crosslinked and deposited into the bone matrix.MethodsSmall RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR were used to detect miRNA levels in patient blood samples and in the cell lysates as well as extracellular vesicles of parental and bone-tropic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The effects of cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles isolated by ultracentrifugation and carrying varying levels of miR-218 were examined in osteoblasts by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and P1NP bone formation marker analysis. Cancer cells overexpressing miR-218 were examined by transcriptome profiling through RNA sequencing to identify intrinsic genes and pathways influenced by miR-218.ResultsWe show that circulating miR-218 is associated with breast cancer bone metastasis. Cancer-secreted miR-218 directly downregulates type I collagen in osteoblasts, whereas intracellular miR-218 in breast cancer cells regulates the expression of inhibin subunits. Increased cancer secretion of inhibin A results in elevated Timp3 expression in osteoblasts and the subsequent repression of procollagen processing during osteoblast differentiation.ConclusionsHere we identify a twofold function of cancer-derived miR-218, whose levels in the blood are associated with breast cancer metastasis to the bone, in the regulation of type I collagen deposition by osteoblasts. The adaptation of the bone niche mediated by miR-218 might further tilt the balance towards osteolysis, thereby facilitating other mechanisms to promote bone metastasis.","2018-10-22","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:19","127","","","20","","Breast Cancer Res.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 12 Place: London Publisher: BMC Web of Science ID: WOS:000448135900003","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\V7GWSKAF\Liu et al. - 2018 - Metastatic breast cancer cells overexpress and sec.pdf","","","ACTIVIN-A; Bone metastasis; BONE-RESORPTION; Breast cancer; Cytokines; DIFFERENTIATION; EXPRESSION; GROWTH; INHIBINS; MARKERS; MIGRATION; miRNA; Osteoblasts; PROMOTE METASTASIS; STEM-CELLS; Type I collagen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-EVs for meniscus regeneration is uncertain, and the mechanisms underlying MSC-EV-mediated tissue regeneration have not been fully elucidated. The aims of this study were to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of intra-articular MSC-EV injection in a meniscus defect model and elucidate the mechanism underlying MSC-EV-mediated tissue regeneration via combined bioinformatic analyses. Methods MSC-EVs were isolated from human synovial MSC culture supernatants via ultrafiltration. To evaluate the meniscus regeneration ability, MSC-EVs were injected intra-articularly in the mouse meniscus defect model immediately after meniscus resection and weekly thereafter. After 1 and 3 weeks, their knees were excised for histological and immunohistochemical evaluations. To investigate the mechanisms through which MSC-EVs accelerate meniscus regeneration, cell growth, migration, and chondrogenesis assays were performed using treated and untreated chondrocytes and synovial MSCs with or without MSC-EVs. RNA sequencing assessed the gene expression profile of chondrocytes stimulated by MSC-EVs. Antagonists of the human chemokine CXCR2 receptor (SB265610) were used to determine the role of CXCR2 on chondrocyte cell growth and migration induced by MSC-EVs. Results In the meniscus defect model, MSC-EV injection accelerated meniscus regeneration and normalized the morphology and composition of the repaired tissue. MSC-EVs stimulated chondrocyte and synovial MSC cell growth and migration. RNA sequencing revealed that MSC-EVs induced 168 differentially expressed genes in the chondrocytes and significantly upregulated CXCL5 and CXCL6 in chondrocytes and synovial MSCs. Suppression of CXCL5 and CXCL6 and antagonism of the CXCR2 receptor binding CXCL5 and CXCL6 negated the influence of MSC-EVs on chondrocyte cell growth and migration. Conclusions Intra-articular MSC-EV administration repaired meniscus defects and augmented chondrocyte and synovial MSC cell growth and migration. Comprehensive transcriptome/RNA sequencing data confirmed that MSC-EVs upregulated CXCL5 and CXCL6 in chondrocytes and mediated the cell growth and migration of these cells via the CXCR2 axis.","2021-07-22","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:19","414","","1","12","","Stem Cell Res.

Herein, nanoscale zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) was attempted as a vector of miRNA delivery to achieve efficient cellular uptake and the release of payloads at a target intracellular site. Proangiogenic miR-21 and pro-osteogenic miR-5106 were selected as the model miRs and incorporated into miR@ZIF-8 nanocomposites via a one-pot method. The results verified that ZIF-8 vector could not only exhibit a high-payload loading efficiency but also promote the cellular uptake, as well as improve the endosomal escape capability of miRNAs. The therapeutic effects of miR@ZIF-8 were further systematically investigated. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that MAPK signaling pathway and PID-HIF1-TF pathway were upregulated by miR-21@ZIF-8 transfection in HUVECs, finally leading to the promotion of angiogenesis, demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Moreover, the miR-5106@ZIF-8 significantly improved the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro and efficiently enhanced bone formation in vivo. In summary, we envisage that the ease of fabrication, versatility, low cytotoxicity, promoted cellular uptake, and promising endosomal escape performance make the miR@ZIF-8 nanocomposite be a potential vector for the efficient delivery of therapeutic nucleic acid drugs.","2022-02-15","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:19","132867","","","430","","Chem.

This makes them an interesting therapeutic tool in cell therapy and regenerative medicine. In part, the therapeutic effect of MSC is mediated by the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EV). The preconditioning of MSC in hypoxia can enhance the regenerative capacity of the secreted EV. In this context, the aim of the study was to evaluate whether EV derived from human MSC cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions affect the osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis of MSC.Material and methods: EV were isolated from MSC maintained for 48 hours in normoxic or hypoxic conditions (3 % O2) using ultrafiltration and size exclusion chromatography. The EV were characterized by Western blot, electron microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. In MSC cultures, the effect of the EV on viability was evaluated using an MTT assay, migration was assessed with the Oris assay while differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes was also studied.Results: the EV increased viability and migration, but no differences were seen between those derived from normoxic and hypoxic culture conditions. The EV, mainly those derived from hypoxia, increased both mineralization, and the expression of osteoblastic genes. However, they did not affect adipogenesis significantly.Conclusions: the EV derived from MSC in hypoxia do not affect adipogenesis but have a greater ability to induce osteo-blastogenesis.

Previous studies suggested that mesenchymal stem cells played important roles in promoting MRONJ lesion healing, but the detailed mechanisms were unknown. Increasing numbers of studies have demonstrated that exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells, especially adipose-derived stem cells, have key roles in stem cell-based therapies by accelerating bone remodeling, facilitating angiogenesis, and promoting wound healing. We hypothesized that exosomes derived from adipose-derived stem cells can prevent MRONJ by accelerating gingival healing and enhancing bone remodeling processes.

EVs are ideal candidates for promoting tissue growth and regeneration. The tissue regenerative potential of EVs raises the tantalizing possibility that immobilizing EVs on implant surfaces could potentially generate highly bioactive and cell-instructive surfaces that would enhance implant integration into the body. Such surfaces could address a critical limitation of current implants, which do not promote bone tissue formation or bond bone. Here, we developed bioactive titanium surface coatings (SurfEV) using two types of EVs: secreted by decidual mesenchymal stem cells (DEVs) and isolated from fermented papaya fluid (PEVs). For each EV type, we determined the size, morphology, and molecular composition. High concentrations of DEVs enhanced cell proliferation, wound closure, and migration distance of osteoblasts. In contrast, the cell proliferation and wound closure decreased with increasing concentration of PEVs. DEVs enhanced Ca/P deposition on the titanium surface, which suggests improvement in bone bonding ability of the implant (i.e., osteointegration). EVs also increased production of Ca and P by osteoblasts and promoted the deposition of mineral phase, which suggests EVs play key roles in cell mineralization. We also found that DEVs stimulated the secretion of secondary EVs observed by the presence of protruding structures on the cell membrane. We concluded that, by functionalizing implant surfaces with specialized EVs, we will be able to enhance implant osteointegration by improving hydroxyapatite formation directly at the surface and potentially circumvent aseptic loosening of implants.","2021-06","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","1445","","6","11","","Nanomaterials","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 17 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000666101600001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\SUNJQQIK\Pansani et al. - 2021 - Extracellular Vesicle-Based Coatings Enhance Bioac.pdf","","","AMORPHOUS CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE; bioactivity; BONE REGENERATION; CAROTENOID BETA-CRYPTOXANTHIN; COMBINATION; DEXAMETHASONE; DIFFERENTIATION; ENDOTHELIAL-CELL; extracellular vesicle; implants; IN-VITRO; OSSEOINTEGRATION; osteoblasts; osteointegration; SURFACE TREATMENTS; titanium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exosomes have been reported in almost all biological fluids and during the failure of bone remodeling. 20 ml of blood samples were obtained from osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic postmenopausal women. After the isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), T cells were separated via the magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) technique. Exosomes were driven from T cells of non-osteoporotic and osteoporotic volunteers. Subsequently, normal osteoblasts were treated with obtained T cell exosomes to assess osteoblastic function and gene expression. Results Runx2, type I collagen, osteopontin, and osteocalcin expression decreased in osteoblasts treated by osteoporotic T cell exosomes. In contrast, an increased expression of the mentioned genes was observed following non-osteoporotic T cell exosome treatment. Additionally, osteoblast alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity treated with non-osteoporotic T cell exosomes increased. However, this activity decreased in another group. Our data demonstrated that T cell exosomes obtained from osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic individuals could alter the osteoblastic function and gene expression by affecting the genes essential for bone remodeling.","2022-08-08","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","272","","1","15","","BMC Res.

In this context, Wharton's jelly (WJ) is an alternative source to bone marrow (BM) for allogeneic transplantation since its isolation does not require an invasive procedure for cell collection and does not raise major ethical concerns. However, the osteogenic capacity of human WJ-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) remains unclear. Methods Here, we compared the baseline osteogenic potential of MSC from WJ and BM cell sources by cytological staining, quantitative real-time PCR and proteomic analysis, and assessed chemical and biological strategies for priming undifferentiated WJ-MSC. Concretely, different inhibitors/activators of the TGF beta 1-BMP2 signalling pathway as well as the secretome of differentiating BM-MSC were tested. Results Cytochemical staining as well as gene expression and proteomic analysis revealed that osteogenic commitment was poor in WJ-MSC. However, stimulation of the BMP2 pathway with BMP2 plus tanshinone IIA and the addition of extracellular vesicles or protein-enriched preparations from differentiating BM-MSC enhanced WJ-MSC osteogenesis. Furthermore, greater outcome was obtained with the use of conditioned media from differentiating BM-MSC. Conclusions Altogether, our results point to the use of master banks of WJ-MSC as a valuable alternative to BM-MSC for orthopaedic conditions.","2019-11-28","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","356","","1","10","","Stem Cell Res.

Herein, bilayered thiolated alginate/PEG diacrylate (BSSPD) hydrogels were fabricated for sequential release of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), which acted in different wound healing phases, to achieve rapid and scarless wound healing. The sEVs secreted by bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (B-sEVs) were released from the lower layer of the hydrogels to promote angiogenesis and collagen deposition by accelerating fibroblast and endothelial cell proliferation and migration during the early inflammation and proliferation phases, while sEVs secreted by miR-29b-3p-enriched bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells were released from the upper layer of the hydrogels and suppressed excessive capillary proliferation and collagen deposition during the late proliferation and maturation phases. In a full-thickness skin defect model of rats and rabbit ears, the wound repair rate, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition were evaluated at different time points after treatment with BSSPD loaded with B-sEVs. Interestingly, during the end of the maturation phase in the in vivo model, tissues in the groups treated with BSSPD loaded with sEVs for sequential release (SR-sEVs@BSSPD) exhibited a more uniform vascular structure distribution, more regular collagen arrangement, and lower volume of hyperplastic scar tissue than tissues in the other groups. Hence, SR-sEVs@BSSPD based on skin repair phases was successfully designed and has considerable potential as a cell-free therapy for scarless wound healing.","2021-04-27","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","2024-01-26 18:24:20","6352-6368","","4","15","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 17 Place: Washington Publisher: Amer Chemical Soc Web of Science ID: WOS:000645436800033","","","","","DRUG-DELIVERY; EXOSOMES; EXPRESSION; MICRORNA; MIR-29B; NETWORKS; PROLIFERATION; PROMOTES; scarless; sequential release; small extracellular vesicles; STEM-CELLS; SUPPRESSION; thiolated alginate/polyethylene glycol diacrylate hydrogels; wound healing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is influenced by the SNS in cold environments. Many studies have confirmed a positive relationship between BAT volume and bone mass, but the influence and mechanism of BAT on bone in vivo and in vitro is still unknown. Two-month-old C57/BL6j male mice were exposed to cold temperature (4 degrees C) to induce BAT generation. BAT volume, bone remodeling and microstructure were assessed after 1 day, 14 days and 28 days of cold exposure. CTX-1, P1NP and IL-6 levels were detected in the serum by ELISA. To determine the effect of BAT on osteoclasts and osteoblasts in vitro, brown adipocyte conditional medium (BAT CM) was collected and added to the differentiation medium of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Micro-CT results showed that the bone volume fraction (BV/TV, %) significantly decreased after 14 days of exposure to cold temperature but recovered after 28 days. Double labeling and TRAP staining in vivo showed that bone remodeling was altered during cold exposure. BAT volume enlarged after 14 days of cold stimulation, and IL-6 increased. BAT CM promoted BMSC mineralization by increasing osteocalcin (Ocn), RUNX family transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and alkaline phosphatase (Alp) expression, while bone absorption was inhibited by BAT CM. In conclusion, restoration of bone volume after cold exposure may be attributed to enlarged BAT. BAT has a beneficial effect on bone mass by facilitating osteogenesis and suppressing osteoclastogenesis.","2022-01-20","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:24:58","778019","","","12","","Front.

Recently, polylactic acid (PLA), calcium silicates (CaSi), and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) have been used to produce bioresorbable functional mineral-doped porous scaffolds-through thermally induced phase separation technique, as materials for bone regeneration. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mineral-doped PLA-based porous scaffolds enriched with exosome vesicles (EVs) on osteogenic commitment of human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hAD-MSCs). Two different mineral-doped scaffolds were produced: PLA-10CaSi-10DCPD and PLA-5CaSi-5DCPD. Scaffolds surface micromorphology was investigated by ESEM-EDX before and after 28 days immersion in simulated body fluid (HBSS). Exosomes were deposited on the surface of the scaffolds and the effect of exosome-enriched scaffolds on osteogenic commitment of hAD-MSCs cultured in proximity of the scaffolds has been evaluated by real time PCR. In addition, the biocompatibility was evaluated by direct-contact seeding hAD-MSCs on scaffolds surface-using MTT viability test. In both formulations, ESEM showed pores similar in shape (circular and elliptic) and size (from 10-30 mu m diameter). The porosity of the scaffolds decreased after 28 days immersion in simulated body fluid. Mineral-doped scaffolds showed a dynamic surface and created a suitable bone-forming microenvironment. The presence of the mineral fillers increased the osteogenic commitment of hAD-MSCs. Exosomes were easily entrapped on the surface of the scaffolds and their presence improved gene expression of major markers of osteogenesis such as collagen type I, osteopontin, osteonectin, osteocalcin. The experimental scaffolds enriched with exosomes, in particular PLA-10CaSi-10DCPD, increased the osteogenic commitment of MSCs. In conclusion, the enrichment of bioresorbable functional scaffolds with exosomes is confirmed as a potential strategy to improve bone regeneration procedures.","2020-03","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:24:58","432","","3","10","","Nanomaterials","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 20 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000526090400032","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\EUTFRXCP\Gandolfi et al. - 2020 - Mineral-Doped Poly(L-lactide) Acid Scaffolds Enric.pdf","","","APATITE-FORMATION; BIOINTERACTIVITY; bioresorbable scaffold; BONE-FORMATION; calcium silicates; CALCIUM-SILICATE CEMENTS; CLINICAL-APPLICATIONS; DELIVERY; DIFFERENTIATION; exosome enriched scaffolds; exosomes; FORMING ABILITY; green bioplastics; human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hAD-MSCs); HYDROXYAPATITE; NANOCOMPOSITES; nanodelivery; natural nanovesicles; personalized regenerative medicine; polylactic acid scaffold; regenerative bone healing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the differences in the drugs carried, and the binding of EXOs to other organs limit their therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, improving the OS-targeting ability of BMSCs EXOs and developing new drugs is crucial for the clinical application of targeted therapy for OS.ResultsIn this study, we constructed a potential therapeutic nano platform by modifying BMSCs EXOs using the bone-targeting peptide SDSSD and encapsulated capreomycin (CAP) within a shell. These constructed nanoparticles (NPs) showed the ability of homologous targeting and bone-targeting exosomes (BT-EXO) significantly promotes cellular endocytosis in vitro and tumor accumulation in vivo. Furthermore, our results revealed that the constructed NPs induced ferroptosis in OS cells by prompting excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), Fe2+ aggregation, and lipid peroxidation and further identified the potential anticancer molecular mechanism of ferroptosis as transduced by the Keap1/Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway. Also, these constructed NP-directed ferroptosis showed significant inhibition of tumor growth in vivo with no significant side effects.ConclusionThese results suggest that these constructed NPs have superior anticancer activity in mouse models of OS in vitro and in vivo, providing a new and promising strategy for combining ferroptosis-based chemotherapy with targeted therapy for OS.","2023-09-30","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:24:59","355","","1","21","","J.

Macrophages in the microenvironment are instrumental in bone metabolism. Amount evidence have revealed that exosomes transmitting lncRNA is crucial nanocarriers for cellular interactions in various biotic procedures, especially, osteogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms of the regulatory relationship between the exosomes and macrophages are awaiting clarification. In the present time study, we aimed to explore the roles of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)-derived exosomes carrying nuclear enrichment enriched transcript 1 (NEAT1) in the osteogenesis mediated by M2 polarized macrophages and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.ResultsWe demonstrated HUVECs-derived exosomes expressing NEAT1 significantly enhanced M2 polarization and attenuated LPS-induced inflammation in vitro. Besides, the conditioned medium from macrophages induced by the exosomes indirectly facilitated the migration and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Mechanically, Exos carrying NEAT1 decreased remarkably both expression of dead-box helicase 3X-linked (DDX3X) and nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3). The level of NLRP3 protein increased significantly after RAW264.7 cells transfected with DDX3X overexpression plasmid. Additionally, the knockdown of NEAT1 in exosomes partially counteracted the aforementioned effect of Exos. The results of air pouch rat model demonstrated that HUVECs-derived exosomes increased anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-6) significantly in vivo, contributing to amelioration of LPS-induced inflammation. Afterwards, we further confirmed that the HUVECs-derived exosomes encapsulated in alginate/gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels could promote the bone regeneration, facilitate the angiogenesis, increase the infiltration of M2 polarized macrophages as well as decrease NLRP3 expression in the rat calvarial defect model.ConclusionsHUVECs-derived exosomes enable transmitting NEAT1 to alleviate inflammation by inducing M2 polarization of macrophages through DDX3X/NLRP3 regulatory axis, which finally contributes to osteogenesis with the aid of alginate/GelMA IPN hydrogels in vivo. Thus, our study provides insights in bone healing with the aid of HUVECs-derived exosomes-encapsulated composite hydrogels, which exhibited potential towards the use of bone tissue engineering in the foreseeable future.","2023-03-20","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:24:59","98","","1","21","","J.

Engineered exosomes carrying curative molecules show promise as alternative osteoporosis therapies, but depend on specifically-functionalized vesicles and appropriate engineering strategies. Here, we developed an exosome delivery system based on exosomes secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The engineered exosomes BT-Exo-siShn3, took advantage of the intrinsic anti-osteoporosis function of these special MSC-derived exosomes and collaborated with the loaded siRNA of the Shn3 gene to enhance the therapeutic effects. Modification of a bone-targeting peptide endowed the BT-Exo-siShn3 an ability to deliver siRNA to osteoblasts specifically. Silencing of the osteoblastic Shn3 gene enhanced osteogenic differentiation, decreased autologous RANKL expression and thereby inhibited osteoclast formation. Furthermore, Shn3 gene silencing increased production of SLIT3 and consequently facilitated vascularization, especially formation of type H vessels. Our study demonstrated that BT-Exo-siShn3 could serve as a promising therapy to kill three birds with one stone and implement comprehensive anti-osteoporosis effects.","2022-04","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:24:59","207-221","","","10","","Bioact.

Macrophages have been shown as a key player in diabetic complications. However, it remains obscure how diabetic milieu affects macrophage-derived exosomes and its implications on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In this study, we aim to define the impact of diabetic milieu on macrophage-derived exosomes, role of extracellular vesicles in intercellular communication with BMSCs, and subsequent effects on osteogenic differentiation and fracture repair. Results: The osteogenic potential and the ability of fracture repair of exosomes derived from diabetic bone marrow-derived macrophages (dBMDM-exos) were revealed to be lower, as compared with non-diabetic bone marrow-derived macrophages (nBMDM-exos) in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, miR-144-5p levels were sharply elevated in dBMDM-exos and it could be transferred into BMSCs to regulate bone regeneration by targeting Smad1. In addition, the adverse effects of dBMDM-exos on the osteogenic potential and the ability of fracture repair were reversed through the suppression of miR-144-5p inhibition in vitro and vivo.

In the bone marrow microenvironment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP), bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-derived exosomal miRNAs play an important role in bone formation and bone resorption, although the pathogenesis has yet to be clarified. Methods. BMSC-derived exosomes from ovariectomized rats (OVX-Exo) and shamoperated rats (Sham-Exo) were co-cultured with bone marrow-derived macrophages to study their effects on osteoclast differentiation. Next-generation sequencing was utilized to identify the differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) between OVX-Exo and Sham-Exo, while target genes were analyzed using bioinformatics. The regulatory effects of miR-27a-3p and miR-196b-5p on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and osteoclast differentiation were verified by gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses. Results. Osteoclast differentiation was significantly enhanced in the OVX-Exo treatment group compared to the Sham-Exo group. Twenty DE-miRNAs were identified between OVX-Exo and Sham-Exo, among which miR-27a-3p and miR-196b-5p promoted the expressions of osteogenic differentiation markers in BMSCs. In contrast, knockdown of miR-27a-3p and miR-196b-5p increased the expressions of osteoclastic markers in osteoclast. These 20 DE-miRNAs were found to target 11435 mRNAs. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses revealed that these target genes were involved in several biological processes and osteoporosisrelated signaling pathways. Conclusion. BMSC-derived exosomal miR-27a-3p and miR-196b-5p may play a positive regulatory role in bone remodeling.","2022-09-22","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:24:59","e13744","","","10","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 21 Place: London Publisher: PeerJ Inc Web of Science ID: WOS:000964564000001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\H3NIPX23\Lai et al. - 2022 - BMSC-derived exosomal miR-27a-3p and miR-196b-5p r.pdf","","","Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell; CELLS; Exosomes; MECHANISM; MicroRNAs; MICRORNAS; Next-generation sequencing; OSTEOBLASTS; Osteoclast; Osteogenic differentiation; OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; Postmenopausal osteoporosis; VALIDATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although many pathways have been dissected in the effort to better understand and characterize MSC potential, the impact of protein N- or O-glycosylation has been neglected. Deficient protein O-mannosylation is a pathomechanism underlying severe congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) that start to develop at the embryonic developmental stage and progress in the adult, often in tissues where MSC exert their function. Here we show that O-mannosylation genes, many of which are putative or verified glycosyltransferases (GTs), are expressed in a similar pattern in MSC from adipose tissue, bone marrow, and umbilical cord blood and that their expression levels are retained constant during mesengenic differentiation. Inhibition of the first players of the enzymatic cascade, POMT1/2, resulted in complete abolishment of chondrogenesis and alterations of adipogenic and osteogenic potential together with a lethal effect during myogenic induction. Since to date, no therapy for CMD is available, we explored the possibility of using MSC extracellular vesicles (EVs) as molecular source of functional GTs mRNA. All MSC secrete POMT1 mRNA-containing EVs that are able to efficiently fuse with myoblasts which are among the most affected cells by CMD. Intriguingly, in a pomt1 patient myoblast line EVs were able to partially revert O-mannosylation deficiency and contribute to a morphology recovery. Altogether, these results emphasize the crucial role of protein O-mannosylation in stem cell fate and properties and open the possibility of using MSC vesicles as a novel therapeutic approach to CMD.","2016-01","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:00","445-458","","2","73","","Cell.

Furthermore, the in vivo study confirmed that 3D-printed porous Mg-containing Akt scaffolds effectively increased bone regeneration in cranial defects of aged rats.

Although the production of regulatory cytokines by MSC transplantation is a critical modulator of tissue regeneration, we focused on exosomes, which are extracellular vesicles that contain proteins and nucleic acids, as a novel additional modulator of cell-to-cell communication and tissue regeneration. To address this, we used radiologic imaging, histological examination, and immunohistochemical analysis to evaluate the role of exosomes isolated from MSC-conditioned medium (CM) in the healing process in a femur fracture model of CD9(-/-) mice, a strain that is known to produce reduced levels of exosomes. We found that the bone union rate in CD9(-/-) mice was significantly lower than wild-type mice because of the retardation of callus formation. The retardation of fracture healing in CD9(-/-) mice was rescued by the injection of exosomes, but this was not the case after the injection of exosomes-free conditioned medium (CM-Exo). The levels of the bone repair-related cytokines, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), MCP-3, and stromal cell-derived factor-1 in exosomes were low compared with levels in CM and CM-Exo, suggesting that bone repair may be in part mediated by other exosome components, such as microRNAs. These results suggest that exosomes in CM facilitate the acceleration of fracture healing, and we conclude that exosomes are a novel factor of MSC paracrine signaling with an important role in the tissue repair process.","2016-12","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:00","1620-1630","","12","5","","Stem Cells Transl.

This study investigates the functions of EVs derived from bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) in osteoporosis (OP) and the molecular mechanism. EVs were isolated from primary BMSCs in mice. A mouse model with OP was induced by ovariectomy. Treatment with EVs restored bone mass and strength, attenuated trabecular bone loss and cartilage damage, and increased osteogenesis while suppressing osteoclastogenesis in ovariectomized mice. In vitro, the EVs treatment improved the osteogenic differentiation of MC-3T3 while inhibiting osteoclastic differentiation of RAW264.7 cells. Microarray analysis revealed a significant upregulation of ubiquitin specific peptidase 7 (USP7) expression in mouse bone tissues following EV treatment. USP7 was found to interact with Yes1 associated transcriptional regulator (YAP1) and stabilize YAP1 protein through deubiquitination modification. YAP1-related genes were enriched in the Wnt/ss-catenin signaling, and overexpression of YAP1 promoted the nuclear translocation of ss-catenin. Functional experiments underscored the critical role of maintaining USP7, YAP1, and ss-catenin levels in the pro-osteogenic and antiosteoclastogenic properties of the BMSC-EVs.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of secretion factors of human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) on osteogenesis of human bone marrow derived MSCs (hBMSCs). The results showed that 20 mu g/ml hUCMSCs secretion factors could initiate osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs without osteogenic induction medium (OIM), and the amount of calcium deposit (stained by Alizarin Red) was significantly increased after the hUCMSCs secretion factors treatment. Real time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real time qRT-PCR) demonstrated that the expression of osteogenesis-related genes including ALP, BMP2, OCN, Osterix, Col1 alpha and Runx2 were significantly up-regulated following hUCMSCs secretion factors treatment. In addition, we found that 10 mu g hUCMSCs secretion factors together with 2x10(5) hBMSCs in the HA/TCP scaffolds promoted ectopic bone formation in nude mice. Local application of 10 mu g hUCMSCs secretion factors with 50 mu l 2% hyaluronic acid hydrogel and 1x10(5) rat bone marrow derived MSCs (rBMSCs) also significantly enhanced the bone repair of rat calvarial bone critical defect model at both 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Moreover, the group that received the hUCMSCs secretion factors treatment had more cartilage and bone regeneration in the defect areas than those in the control group. Taken together, these findings suggested that hUCMSCs secretion factors can initiate osteogenesis of bone marrow MSCs and promote bone repair. Our study indicates that hUCMSCs secretion factors may be potential sources for promoting bone regeneration.","2015-03-23","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:00","e0120593","","3","10","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 16 Place: San Francisco Publisher: Public Library Science Web of Science ID: WOS:000351987300157","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\J3QNQDF9\Wang et al. - 2015 - The Effects of Secretion Factors from Umbilical Co.pdf","","","BONE REGENERATION; CARTILAGE; MARROW; MECHANISMS; OSTEOBLAST; PHOSPHATE; REPAIR; SCAFFOLDS; STROMAL CELLS; TISSUE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This results in a heavily vascularized tissue where endothelial cells and skeletal cells are constantly in crosstalk to facilitate homeostasis, a process that is mediated by numerous environmental signals, including mechanical loading. Breakdown in this communication can lead to disease and/or poor fracture repair. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the role of mature bone cells in regulating angiogenesis, how this is influenced by a dynamic mechanical environment, and understand the mechanism by which this could occur. Herein, we demonstrate that both osteoblasts and osteocytes coordinate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and blood vessel formation via a mechanically dependent paracrine mechanism. Moreover, we identified that this process is mediated via the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), as isolated EVs from mechanically stimulated bone cells elicited the same response as seen with the full secretome, while the EV-depleted secretome did not elicit any effect. Despite mechanically activated bone cell-derived EVs (MA-EVs) driving a similar response to VEGF treatment, MA-EVs contain minimal quantities of this angiogenic factor. Lastly, a miRNA screen identified mechanoresponsive miRNAs packaged within MA-EVs which are linked with angiogenesis. Taken together, this study has highlighted an important mechanism in osteogenic-angiogenic coupling in bone and has identified the mechanically activated bone cell-derived EVs as a therapeutic to promote angiogenesis and potentially bone repair.","2023","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:01","20417314231186918","","","14","","J.

A potent stimulus driving this process is mechanical loading. Osteocytes are mechanosensitive cells which play fundamental roles in coordinating loading-induced bone formation via the secretion of paracrine factors. However, the exact mechanisms by which osteocytes relay mechanical signals to these progenitor cells are poorly understood. Therefore, this study aimed to demonstrate the potency of the mechanically stimulated osteocyte secretome in driving human bone marrow stem/stromal cell (hMSC) recruitment and differentiation, and characterize the secretome to identify potential factors regulating stem cell behavior and bone mechanobiology. We demonstrate that osteocytes subjected to fluid shear secrete a distinct collection of factors that significantly enhance hMSC recruitment and osteogenesis and demonstrate the key role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in driving these effects. This demonstrates the pro-osteogenic potential of osteocyte-derived mechanically activated extracellular vesicles, which have great potential as a cell-free therapy to enhance bone regeneration and repair in diseases such as osteoporosis.","2020-11","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:01","1431-1447","","11","9","","Stem Cells Transl.

EVs contain numerous functional proteins and nucleic acids derived from their parent cells and have different roles depending on their origin. Functionally, EVs transfer these biological ma-terials from the parent cell to the recipient and thus exhibits a novel therapeutic platform for delivering ther-apeutics molecules to the target tissue. In this regard, EVs derived from stem cells such as Mesenchymal Stem Cells and iPSCs have demonstrated a higher ability to benefit regenerative medicine. Even though these stem cells share some common properties, due to the differences in their origin (cell sources, the hierarchy of potency, etc) the EVs cargo profiling and functionality may vary.Method: We used iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis to conduct a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of EVs derived from iPSCs and various tissue-specific MSCs in this study. Additionally, the data was analyzed using a variety of bioinformatic tools, including ProteinPilot for peptide and protein identification and quantification; Funrich, GO, Reactome, and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) for pathway enrichment; the STRING database, and the inBio Discover tool for identifying known and predicted Protein-Protein networks.Results: Bioinformatics analysis revealed 223 differentially expressed proteins in these EVs; however, Wharton's jelly MSC-EV contained more exclusive proteins with higher protein expression levels. Additionally, 113 proteins were abundant in MSC-EVs, while others were shared between MSC-EVs and iPSC-EVs. Further, based on an in-depth examination of the proteins, their associated pathways, and their interactions with other proteins, it was determined that these proteins are involved in bone regeneration (9.3%), wound healing (4.4%), immune regulation (8.9%), cardiac regeneration (6.6%), neuro regeneration (8.9%), and hepatic regeneration (3.5%). Conclusion: Overall, the results of our proteomic analysis indicate that EVs derived from MSCs have a more robust profile of proteins with higher expression levels than iPSCs. This is a significant finding, as it demonstrates the critical therapeutic role of EVs in a variety of diseases, as demonstrated by enrichment analysis, their versatility, and broad application potential.","2022-11-15","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:01","113354","","2","420","","Exp.

Therefore, a novel method to promote diabetic wound healing is of considerable interest at present. Previous studies showed that injection of MSC derived exosomes has beneficial effects on wound healing. In current studies, we aimed to isolate exosomes derived from gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) and then loading them to the chitosan/silk hydrogel sponge to evaluate the effects of this novel non-invasive method on skin defects in diabetic rats. Methods: GMSCs were isolated from human gingival connective tissue and characterized by surface antigen analysis and in vitro multipotent differentiation. The cell supernatant was collected to isolate the exosomes. The exosomes were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Western blot and size distribution analysis. The chitosan/silk-based hydrogel sponge was prepared using the freeze-drying method and then structural and physical properties were characterized. Then, the exosomes were added to the hydrogel and tested in a diabetic rat skin defect model. The effects were evaluated by wound area measurement, histological, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis. Results: We have successfully isolated GMSCs and exosomes with a mean diameter of 127 nm. The chitosan/silk hydrogel had the appropriate properties of swelling and moisture retention capacity. The in vivo studies showed that the incorporating of GMSC-derived exosomes to hydrogel could effectively promote healing of diabetic skin defects. The histological analysis revealed more neo-epithelium and collagen in the hydrogel-exosome group. In addition, the hydrogel-exosome group had the highest microvessel density and nerve density. Conclusions: The combination of GMSC-derived exosomes and hydrogel could effectively promote skin wound healing in diabetic rats by promoting the re-epithelialization, deposition and remodeling of collagen and by enhancing angiogenesis and neuronal ingrowth. These findings not only provide new information on the role of the GMSC-derived exosomes in wound healing but also provide a novel non-invasive application method of exosomes with practical value for skin repair.","2017-11-07","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:01","904","","","8","","Front.

In the present study, we identified the exosomes derived from PDLSCs and found that osteogenic induction can enhance the osteogenic ability of PDLSC-derived exosomes in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs). To investigate the underlying mechanism, we analyzed the exosomal miRNA expression profiles of undifferentiated and osteogenic differentiated PDLSCs by RNA sequencing. The results showed that seventy-two miRNAs were upregulated and thirty-five miRNAs were downregulated after osteogenic induction. The results of Gene Ontology analysis and pathway analysis demonstrated that the target genes of differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs participate in the regulation of a variety of biological processes, such as catalytic activity, protein binding, metabolic processes, cell development, and differentiation, and are enriched in osteogenic differentiation-related pathways, such as MAPK signaling, AMPK signaling, and insulin signaling pathways. Our results reveal for the first time that the exosomal miRNAs derived from osteogenic differentiated PDLSCs may promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, which provides a basis for further research on the regulatory function of exosomal miRNA of PDLSCs during osteogenesis.","2020-11-19","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:01","8852307","","","2020","","Stem Cells Int.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 13 Place: London Publisher: Hindawi Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000595821800002","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\KGFQZMWM\Liu et al. - 2020 - Human Periodontal Ligament Stem Cell-Derived Exoso.pdf","","","ANGIOGENESIS; DIFFERENTIATION; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; MARROW; MECHANISM; OSTEOBLASTS; OSTEOGENESIS; PATHWAY; PROLIFERATION; RENAL-CANCER","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exosomes derived from bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC-Exos) have been confirmed to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis. The magnetic nanoparticles (eg. Fe3O4, gamma -Fe2O3) combined with a static magnetic field (SMF) has been commonly used to increase wound healing and bone regeneration. Hence, this study aims to evaluate whether exosomes derived from BMSCs preconditioned with a low dose of Fe3O4 nanoparticles with or without the SMF, exert superior pro-osteogenic and pro-angiogenic activities in bone regeneration and the underlying mechanisms involved.MethodsTwo novel types of exosomes derived from preconditioned BMSCs that fabricated by regulating the contents with the stimulation of magnetic nanoparticles and/or a SMF. Then, the new exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized. Afterwards, we conducted in vitro experiments in which we measured osteogenic differentiation, cell proliferation, cell migration, and tube formation, then established an in vivo critical-sized calvarial defect rat model. The miRNA expression profiles were compared among the exosomes to detect the potential mechanism of improving osteogenesis and angiogenesis. At last, the function of exosomal miRNA during bone regeneration was confirmed by utilizing a series of gain- and loss-of-function experiments in vitro.Results50 mu g/mL Fe3O4 nanoparticles and a 100 mT SMF were chosen as the optimum magnetic conditions to fabricate two new exosomes, named BMSC-Fe3O4-Exos and BMSC-Fe3O4-SMF-Exos. They were both confirmed to enhance osteogenesis and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo compared with BMSC-Exos, and BMSC-Fe3O4-SMF-Exos had the most marked effect. The promotion effect was found to be related to the highly riched miR-1260a in BMSC-Fe3O4-SMF-Exos. Furthermore, miR-1260a was verified to enhance osteogenesis and angiogenesis through inhibition of HDAC7 and COL4A2, respectively.ConclusionThese results suggest that low doses of Fe3O4 nanoparticles combined with a SMF trigger exosomes to exert enhanced osteogenesis and angiogenesis and that targeting of HDAC7 and COL4A2 by exosomal miR-1260a plays a crucial role in this process. This work could provide a new protocol to promote bone regeneration for tissue engineering in the future.","2021-07-13","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:03","209","","1","19","","J.

How the brain-driven endocrine axes maintain bone homeostasis, especially under metabolic disorders, remains obscure. Here, we found that neural stem cells (NSCs) residing in the subventricular zone participated in lipid metabolism homeostasis of regenerative bone through exosomal perilipin 5 (PLIN5). Fluorescence-labeled exosomes tracing and histological detection identified that NSC-derived exosomes (NSC-Exo) could travel from the lateral ventricle into bone injury sites. Homocysteine (Hcy) led to osteogenic and angiogenic impairment, whereas the NSC-Exo were confirmed to restore it. Mecobalamin, a clinically used neurotrophic drug, further enhanced the protective effects of NSC-Exo through increased PLIN5 expression. Mechanistically, NSC-derived PLIN5 reversed excessive Hcy-induced lipid metabolic imbalance and aberrant lipid droplet accumulation through lipophagy-dependent intracellular lipolysis. Intracerebroventricular administration of mecobalamin and/or AAV-shPlin5 confirmed the effects of PLIN5-driven endocrine modulations on new bone formation and vascular reconstruction in hyperhomocysteinemic and high-fat diet models. This study uncovered a novel brain-skeleton axis that NSCs in the mammalian brain modulated bone regeneration through PLIN5-driven lipid metabolism modulation, providing evidence for lipid- or bone-targeted medicine development.","2023-05-03","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:03","1293-1312","","5","31","","Mol.

However, osseointegration with host tissue is often not definite, which may cause implant failure at times. The present study investigates the capacity of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-secretome, formulated as a ready-to-use and freeze-dried medicinal product (the Lyosecretome), to promote the osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties of titanium cages. In vitro tests were conducted using adipose tissue-derived MSCs seeded on titanium cages with or without Lyosecretome. After 14 days, in the presence of Lyosecretome, significant cell proliferation improvement was observed. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the cytocompatibility of titanium cages: the seeded MSCs showed a spread morphology and an initial formation of filopodia. After 7 days, in the presence of Lyosecretome, more frequent and complex cellular processes forming bridges across the porous surface of the scaffold were revealed. Also, after 14 and 28 days of culturing in osteogenic medium, the amount of mineralized matrix detected by alizarin red was significantly higher when Lyosecretome was used. Finally, improved osteogenesis with Lyosecretome was confirmed by confocal analysis after 28 and 56 days of treatment, and demonstrating the production by osteoblast-differentiated MSCs of osteocalcin, a specific bone matrix protein.","2021-08","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:03","8445","","16","22","","Int.

Such a disorder of adipogenic/osteogenic differentiation, affecting bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), contributes to bone loss during aging. Here, we investigated the effects of extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from human (h)BMSCs during different stages of osteogenic differentiation on the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacity of naive (undifferentiated) hBMSCs. We observed that all EV groups increased viability and proliferation capacity and suppressed the apoptosis of naive hBMSCs. In particular, EVs derived from hBMSCs at late-stage osteogenic differentiation promoted the osteogenic potential of naive hBMSCs more effectively than EVs derived from naive hBMSCs (naive EVs), as indicated by the increased gene expression of COL1A1 and OPN. In contrast, the adipogenic differentiation capacity of naive hBMSCs was inhibited by treatment with EVs from osteogenic differentiated hBMSCs. Proteomic analysis revealed that osteogenic EVs and naive EVs contained distinct protein profiles, with pro-osteogenic and anti-adipogenic proteins encapsulated in osteogenic EVs. We speculate that osteogenic EVs could serve as an intercellular communication system between bone- and bone-marrow adipose tissue, for transporting osteogenic factors and thus favoring pro-osteogenic processes. Our data may support the theory of an endocrine circuit with the skeleton functioning as a ductless gland.","2022-08","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:03","2491","","16","11","","Cells","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 22 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000846995100001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\X48Z4VEJ\Wang et al. - 2022 - Effects of Extracellular Vesicles from Osteogenic .pdf","","","adipogenic differentiation; ADIPOSITY; BINDING; bone regeneration; CARTILAGE; ECM remodeling; EXOSOMES; extracellular vesicles; mesenchymal stem cells; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; osteogenic differentiation; osteogenic potential; STEROID-INDUCED OSTEONECROSIS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the underlying mechanisms still remain unknown. Exosomes, a series of extracellular vesicles, have recently emerged as potential paracrine mediators in cell-cell communication. However, whether exosomes and exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the chemical signals of biomaterials-modulated BMSCs-ECs communication are unknown. Hence, in the present study, a model Li-incorporated bioactive glass ceramic (Li-BGC) was applied to explore the chemical signals of biomaterials mediated cell-cell communication between BMSCs and ECs. Our results showed that Li-BGC directly promoted the pro-angiogenic capability of HUVECs in vitro and new blood vessel ingrowth in vivo. Moreover, Li-BGC activated Wnt/beta-catenin, AKT and NF-kappa B signaling pathways, while AKT signaling pathway might function as the upstream of Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. More importantly, Li-BGC further facilitated the pro-angiogenic capacity of HUVECs by eliciting the expression of exosomal pro-angiogenic miR-130a in BMSCs-derived exosomes, which subsequently leading to the downregulation of PTEN protein and activation of AKT pathway, ultimately resulting in the elevated proliferation, migration and tube formation of endothelial cells, as well as the upregulated expression of pro-angiogenic genes.

The deletion of IL-12p40 (a common subunit of IL-12 and IL-23) can improve bone regeneration. However, the relative roles of IL-12 and IL-23 in bone disorders are largely unknown. Methods: Ectopic bone formation and skull defect models were established to evaluate the relative roles of IL-12 and IL-23 in inflammatory bone disorders. Differences in bone mass among WT, IL-12p35(-/-), and IL-12p40(-/-) mice (young and elderly) were detected by micro-CT. Osteogenic and osteoclastic activities were explored using ELISA, qRT-PCR, and histological analysis. Moreover, the mechanisms by which IL-12 and IL-23 regulated the differentiation of BMMSCs and RAW264.7 cells were explored using Alizarin Red and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining in vitro. Apilimod was used to inhibit IL-12 and IL-23 production in vivo. Results: Mice deficient in IL-12p40 promoted bone formation and protected against aging-related bone loss. By contrast, bone loss was aggravated in IL-12(-/-) mice, suggesting that IL-23 may play a dominant role in inflammation-related bone disorders. Mechanistically, IL-12 and IL-23 coupled osteogenesis and osteoclastic activities to regulate bone homeostasis and repair. IL-23 deficiency increased bone formation and inhibited bone resorption. Finally, apilimod treatment significantly improved bone regeneration and calvarial defect repair. Conclusion: These data collectively uncover a previously unrecognized role of IL-23 in skeletal tissue engineering. Thus, IL-23 can act as a biomarker to predict diseases and treatment efficacy, and apilimod can be used as an effective therapeutic drug to combat inflammatory bone disorders","2020","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:04","3925-3938","","9","10","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 14 Place: Lake Haven Publisher: Ivyspring Int Publ Web of Science ID: WOS:000518773300006","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\7SWWSSX2\Xu et al. - 2020 - IL-23, but not IL-12, plays a critical role in inf.pdf","","","BMMSCs; bone formation/resorption; bone regeneration; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; GENE-EXPRESSION; IFN-GAMMA; IL-12; IL-23; IL-23/IL-17 AXIS; MARROW-CELLS; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; OSTEOCLAST FORMATION; RECEPTOR ACTIVATOR; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; T-CELLS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is increasingly accepted that MSCs mediate tissue repair through secretion of trophic factors, particularly exosomes. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effects of human MSC exosome-loaded collagen sponge for regeneration of surgically created periodontal intrabony defects in an immunocompetent rat model. We observed that relative to control rats, exosome-treated rats repaired the defects more efficiently with regeneration of periodontal tissues including newly-formed bone and periodontal ligament (PDL). We also observed that concomitant with this, there was increased cellular infiltration and proliferation. We therefore postulated that MSC exosomes enhanced regeneration through increased cellular mobilisation and proliferation. Using PDL cell cultures, we demonstrated that MSC exosomes could increase PDL cell migration and proliferation through CD73-mediated adenosine receptor activation of pro-survival AKT and ERK signalling. Inhibition of AKT or ERK phosphorylation suppressed PDL cell migration and proliferation. Our findings demonstrated for the first time that MSC exosomes enhance periodontal regeneration possibly by increasing PDL migration and proliferation. This study suggests that MSC exosome is a viable ready-to-use and cell-free MSC therapeutic for the treatment of periodontal defects. Statement of significance Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies have demonstrated regenerative potential for the treatment of periodontal defects. However, translation of cellular therapies is hampered by challenges in maintaining optimal cell vitality and viability from manufacturing and storage to final delivery to patients. Although the use of MSCs for tissue repair was first predicated on their differentiation potential, the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs has increasingly been attributed to its paracrine secretion, particularly exosomes or small extracellular vesicles. In this study, MSC exosome-loaded collagen sponge enhanced periodontal regeneration in an immunocompetent rat periodontal defect model without any obvious adverse effects. These findings provide the basis for future development of MSC exosomes as a cell-free strategy for periodontal regeneration. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, EVs released by osteoblasts at different stages of the mineralization process were investigated for their potential ability to promote bone formation. Results showed that the characteristics of EVs of mineralizing osteoblasts changed with regularity. EVs derived from the mid-to-late differentiation stage remarkably promoted osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and improved osteoporosis in ovariectomized mice. The findings also revealed that the effect of EVs on osteogenesis was related with the maturity of matrix vesicles (MVs), a kind of EVs selectively released by mineralizing-related cells. Nevertheless, only the EVs from the mid-to-late stage showed osteoinductive properties, Synthetic cartilage lymph (SCL) treatment of EVs from the middle stage could promote MV maturation but showed no effect on osteoinduction. Additionally, EVs derived at the middle and mid-to-late stages showed innate bone-targeting potential.

Here, we report the pro-osteogenic capacity of exosomes derived from human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) to facilitate bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) differentiation and mineralization. To support their delivery, we engineered a biodegradable polymer delivery platform to improve the encapsulation and the controlled release of exosomes on a tunable time scale from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) triblock copolymer microspheres. Our delivery platform integrates within three-dimensional tissue engineering scaffolds to enable a straightforward surgical insertion into a mouse calvarial defect. We demonstrate the osteogenic potential of these functional constructs in vitro and in vivo . Controlled release of osteogenic hDPSC-derived exosomes facilitates osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, leading to mineralization to a degree which is comparable to exogenous administration of the same exosomes in human and mouse BMSCs. By recruiting endogenous cells to the defects and facilitating their differentiation, the controlled release of osteogenic exosomes from a tissue engineering scaffold demonstrates accelerated bone healing in vivo at 8 weeks. Exosomes recapitulate the advantageous properties of mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells, without manufacturing or immunogenic concerns associated with transplantation of exogenous cells.

Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) derived exosomes (Exos) contain multiple biosignal molecules and have been demonstrated to exhibit immunomodulatory functions. Herein, we develop a BMSC-derived Exos-functionalized implant to accelerate bone integration by immunoregulation. BMSC-derived Exos were reversibly incorporated on tannic acid (TA) modified sulfonated polyetheretherketone (SPEEK) via the strong interaction of TA with biomacromolecules. The slowly released Exos from SPEEK can be phagocytosed by co-cultured cells, which could efficiently improve the biocompatibilities of SPEEK. In vitro results showed the Exos loaded SPEEK promoted macrophage M2 polarization via the NF-kappa B pathway to enhance BMSCs osteogenic differentiation. Further in vivo rat air-pouch model and rat femoral drilling model assessment of Exos loaded SPEEK revealed efficient macrophage M2 polarization, desirable new bone formation, and satisfactory osseointegration. Thus, BMSC-derived Exos-functionalized implant exerted osteoimmunomodulation effect to promote osteogenesis.","2021-09","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:04","2754-2766","","9","6","","Bioact.

Although much is known regarding perivascular cell regulation of osteoblasts, their regulation of osteoclasts, and by extension utility in states of high bone resorption, is not known. Here, human perivascular stem cells (PSCs) were used as a means to prevent autograft resorption in a gonadectomy-induced osteoporotic spine fusion model. Furthermore, the paracrine regulation by PSCs of osteoclast formation was evaluated, using coculture, conditioned medium, and purified extracellular vesicles. Results showed that PSCs when mixed with autograft bone induce an increase in osteoblast:osteoclast ratio, promote bone matrix formation, and prevent bone graft resorption. The confluence of these factors resulted in high rates of fusion in an ovariectomized rat lumbar spine fusion model. Application of PSCs was superior across metrics to either the use of unpurified, culture-defined adipose-derived stromal cells or autograft bone alone. Under coculture conditions, PSCs negatively regulated osteoclast formation and did so via secreted, nonvesicular paracrine factors. Total RNA sequencing identified secreted factors overexpressed by PSCs which may explain their negative regulation of graft resorption. In summary, PSCs reduce osteoclast formation and prevent bone graft resorption in high turnover states such as gonadectomy-induced osteoporosis.","2020-12","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:04","1617-1630","","12","9","","Stem Cells Transl.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays a critical role in bone development. However, HIF-1 is easily biodegradable under normoxic conditions. The bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were transfected with adenovirus carrying triple point-mutations (amino acids 402, 564, and 803) in the HIF-1 coding sequence (CDS). The mutant HIF-1 can efficiently express functional proteins under normoxic conditions. To date, no study has reported the role of exosomes secreted by mutant HIF-1 modified BMSCs in the recovery of the early steroid-induced avascular necrosis of femoral head (SANFH). In this study, we firstly analyzed exosomes derived from BMSCs modified by mutant (BMSC-Exos(MU)) or wild-type HIF-1 (BMSC-Exos(WT)). In vitro, we investigated the osteogenic differentiation capacity of BMSCs modified by BMSC-Exos(MU) or BMSC-Exos(WT), and the angiogenesis effects of BMSC-Exos(MU) and BMSC-Exos(WT) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Besides, the healing of the femoral head was also assessed in vivo. We found that the potential of osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs treated with BMSC-Exos(MU) was higher than the wild-type group in vitro. In addition, BMSC-Exos(MU) stimulated the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with the BMSC-Exos(WT) or PBS control group, the injection of BMSC-Exos(MU) into the necrosis region markedly accelerated the bone regeneration and angiogenesis, which were indicated by the increased trabecular reconstruction and microvascular density. Taken together, our data suggest that BMSC-Exos(MU) facilitates the repair of SANFH by enhancing osteogenesis and angiogenesis.","2017-12","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:04","1379-1390","","12","41","","Cell Biol.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based tissue engineering strategies have been introduced to enhance bone tissue repair. However, the risk of related complications is limiting their usage. To overcome these drawbacks, exosomes (EXOs) derived from MSCs have been recently proposed as a cell-free alternative to MSCs to direct tissue regeneration. It was hypothesized that there is a correlation between the biological properties of exosomes derived from the dental pulp and the age of the donor. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of EXOs derived from dental pulp stem cells of permanent teeth (old donor group) or exfoliated deciduous teeth (young donor group) on MSCs cultured in vitro. Proliferation potential was evaluated by doubling time, and commitment ability by gene expression and biochemical quantification for tissue-specific factors. Results showed a well-defined proliferative influence for the younger donor aged group. Similarly, a higher commitment ability was detected in the young group. In conclusion, EXOs could be employed to promote bone regeneration, likely playing an important role in neo-angiogenesis in early healing phases.","2022-05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:04","908","","5","14","","Pharmaceutics","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 12 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000801509000001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\LX45BZFN\Brunello et al. - 2022 - Exosomes Derived from Dental Pulp Stem Cells Show .pdf","","","bone regeneration; COMMITMENT; dental pulp; exosomes; mesenchymal stem cells; miRNA; regenerative medicine; SCAFFOLDS; TISSUE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of time delays on the growth of tumor cells and bone system are studied in multiple myeloma-induced bone disease. In the case of small osteoclast-derived paracrine signaling, it is found that the growth of tumor cells slows down, the oscillation period of the ratio of osteoclasts to osteoblasts is extended with increasing time delay, and there is a competition between the delay and osteoclast-derived paracrine signaling. In the case of large tumor-derived paracrine signaling, the tumor-derived paracrine signaling can induce a more significant decline in tumor growth for long time delay, and thus slowing down the progression of bone disease. There is an optimal coupling between the tumor-derived paracrine signaling of osteoclasts and time delay during the progressions of bone diseases, which suppresses the tumor growth and the regression of bone disease.","2017-03","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:04","030503","","3","26","","Chin.

Materials and Methods: By means of lentiviral transfection, miR-130a-3p overexpression and knockdown ADSCs were constructed. Alizarin Red S was used to detect the calcium deposits, and qPCR was used to detect osteogenesis-related genes, to verify the effect of miR-130a-3p on the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs. CCK-8 was used to detect the effect of miR-130a-3p on the proliferation of ADSCs. The target binding between miR-130a-3p and SIRT7 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Furthermore, the role of Wnt signalling pathway in the regulation of ADSCs osteogenesis and differentiation by miR-130a-3p was further verified by detecting osteogenic-related genes and proteins and alkaline phosphatase activity. Results: (a) Overexpression of miR-130a-3p can enhance the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs while reducing protein and mRNA levels of SIRT7, a target of miR-130a-3p. (b) Our study further found that overexpression of miR-130a-3p leads to down-regulation of SIRT7 expression with up-regulation of Wnt signalling pathway-associated protein. (c) Overexpression of miR-130a-3p inhibited proliferation of ADSCs, while knockdown promoted it. Conclusions: The obtained findings indicate that exosomal miR-130a-3p can promote osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs partly by mediating SIRT7/Wnt/beta-catenin axis, which will hence promote the application of exosomal microRNA in the field of bone regeneration.","2020-10","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","e12890","","10","53","","Cell Prolif.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 12 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000559932000001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\ZD2UB2RM\Yang et al. - 2020 - Exosomal miR-130a-3p regulates osteogenic differen.pdf","","","ACTIVATION; Adipose-derived stem cells; BETA-CATENIN; bone regeneration; BONE-FORMATION; CARCINOMA; exosomes; MECHANISM; MICRORNAS; miR-130a-3p; SIRT7; TISSUE; Wnt/beta-catenin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a vital mediator between inflammatory response and bone regeneration, M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (M2-Exos) attenuate inflammation and promote tissue repair. However, due to a lack of specific targeting property, M2-Exos will be rapidly eliminated after systematic administration, thus compromising their effectiveness in promoting bone regeneration. To solve this hurdle, we initially harvested and characterized the pro-osteogenic properties of M2-Exos. A bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-specific aptamer was synthesized and 3-way junction (3WJ) RNA nanoparticles were applied to conjugate the BMSC-specific aptamer and M2-Exos. In vitro assays revealed that M2-Exos bore the representative features of exosomes and significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. 3WJ RNA nanoparticles-aptamer functionalized M2-Exos (3WJ-BMSCapt/M2-Exos) maintained the original physical characteristics of M2-Exos, but bore a high specific binding ability to BMSCs. Furthermore, when being systemically administered in the mice model with femoral bone fractures, these functionalized M2-Exos mainly accumulated at the bone fracture site with a slow release of exosomal cargo, thereby significantly accelerating the healing processes compared with the M2-Exos group. Our study indicated that the 3WJ-BMSCapt/M2-Exos with BMSCs targeting ability and controlled release would be a promising strategy to treat bone fractures.

However, the role of EPCs in osteoclastogenesis is unclear. In this study, we assess the effects of EPC-derived exosomes on the migration and osteoclastic differentiation of primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) in vitro using immunofluorescence, western blotting, RT-PCR and Transwell assays. We also evaluated the effects of EPC-derived exosomes on the homing and osteoclastic differentiation of transplanted BMMs in a mouse bone fracture model in vivo. We found that EPCs cultured with BMMs secreted exosomes into the medium and, compared with EPCs, exosomes had a higher expression level of LncRNA-MALAT1. We confirmed that LncRNA-MALAT1 directly binds to miR-124 to negatively control miR-124 activity. Moreover, overexpression of miR-124 could reverse the migration and osteoclastic differentiation of BMMs induced by EPC-derived exosomes. A dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that the integrin ITGB1 is the target of miR-124. Mice treated with EPC-derived exosome-BMM co-transplantations exhibited increased neovascularization at the fracture site and enhanced fracture healing compared with those treated with BMMs alone. Overall, our results suggest that EPC-derived exosomes can promote bone repair by enhancing recruitment and differentiation of osteoclast precursors through LncRNA-MALAT1.","2019-06","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","2024-01-26 18:25:05","3843-3854","","6","23","","J.

Here, a novel gene vector was developed by layer-by-layer self-assembly method using polyethyleneimine (PEI) and Exos derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to deliver large plasmids efficiently. Moreover, a hypoxia-specific expression plasmid was constructed by combining hypoxia promoter RTP801 and microRNA 877 (miR877) sponge. Experimental results showed that the gene delivery vector based on Exos exhibited high transfection efficiency and low cytotoxicity to MSCs. The hypoxia-specific expression plasmid significantly increased bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) expression in hypoxic condition and promoted neoangiogenesis.

The role of exosomal circRNA derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) has not been well-defined. The present study aimed to clarify the regulatory function and molecular mechanism of BMSC-derived exosomal circRNA in osteogenesis. Exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC-Exos) were isolated and identified. BMSC-Exos' pro-osteogenic effect on MC3T3-E1 cells was validated by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and Alizarin Red staining. Through bioinformatic analysis and molecular experiments, circHIPK3 was selected and verified as the key circRNA of BMSC-Exos to promote osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. Mechanistically, circHIPK3 acted as an miR-29a-5p sponge and functioned in mitophagy via targeting miR-29a-5p and PINK1. Additionally, we showed that the mitophagy level of MC3T3-E1 cells were mediated by BMSC-Exos, which promoted the osteogenic differentiation. Collectively, our results revealed an important role for BMSC-derived exosomal circHIPK3 in osteogenesis.

In the present study, we report that TregD-Exos containing miR-142-3p can be shuttled into bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) promoting osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Overexpression of miR-142-3p remarkedly promoted BMSC osteoblastic differentiation, and enhanced HUVEC function, including proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. Furthermore, TGFBR1/SMAD2 was shown to be involved in the TregD-Exos' promotive effect on bone healing. Moreover, both TregD-Exos and miR-142-3p administration restored bone repair in vivo. Taken together, our results indicate that TregD-Exos containing miR-142-3p can be transferred to BMSCs and HUVECs with robust effects on osteogenesis and angiogenesis.

Conventional treatment strategies show limited efficacy in promoting regeneration of damaged periodontal tissues. Here, a delivery platform is developed for small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) to treat periodontitis. EVs can achieve comparable therapeutic effects to their cells of origin. However, the short half-lives of EVs after their administration along with their rapid diffusion away from the delivery site necessitate frequent administration to achieve therapeutic benefits. To address these issues, ""dual delivery"" microparticles are engineered enabling microenvironment-sensitive release of EVs by metalloproteinases at the affected site along with antibiotics to suppress bacterial biofilm growth. GMSC sEVs are able to decrease the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytes/macrophages and T cells, suppress T-cell activation, and induce the formation of T regulatory cells (Tregs) in vitro and in a rat model of periodontal disease. One-time administration of immunomodulatory GMSC sEV-decorated microparticles leads to a significant improvement in regeneration of the damaged periodontal tissue. This approach will have potential clinical applications in the regeneration of a variety of tissues.","2022-06","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:36","2102593","","12","11","","Adv.

Diabetes is one of the most important factors contributing to periodontitis. Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) have been reported to promote bone regeneration. This study aimed to examine the function and mechanism of exosomes derived from periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs-Exo) in regulating periodontal regeneration in diabetic periodontitis.Methods: Exosomes derived from normal-glucose-cultured PDLSCs (NG-PDLSCs-Exo) and high-glucose-preconditioned PDLSCs (HG-PDLSCs-Exo) were used. Their effects on RAW264.7 cells were investigated by TRAP staining and quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The role of exosomal miR-31-5p in osteoclast differentiation was tested using qRT-PCR, double luciferase analysis, and Western blotting. We investigated the effects of these two types of PDLSCs-Exo on alveolar bone loss in vivo in mice with experimental periodontitis.Results: PDLSCs-Exo were transferred to RAW264.7, and HG-PDLSCs-Exo inhibited osteoclast formation to a lesser extent than NG-PDLSCs-Exo. Further studies revealed the effect of PDLSCs-Exo on osteoclastogenesis via the miR-31-5p/eNOS signaling pathway. In mice with experimental periodontitis, PDLSCs-Exo reduced alveolar bone destruction and decreased the number of osteoclasts on the alveolar bone surface.Conclusion: Our results suggest that exosomal miR-31-5p derived from PDLSCs regulates alveolar bone regeneration by targeting eNOS.","2023","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:36","5327-5342","","","18","","Int.

However, the use of MSC therapies is complicated by a lack of understanding of the behaviour of cells and repair within the joint. Current methods of MSC tracking include labelling the cells with Super Paramagnetic Iron Oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs). However, standard acquisition sequences (T-2 and T-2*) give poor anatomical definition in the presence of SPIOs. To avoid anatomical compromise in the presence of SPIOs, we have investigated the use of Ultra-short Echo Time (UTE) MRI, using a 3D cones acquisition trajectory. This method was used to track SPIO labelled MSC injected into joints containing osteochondral defects in experimental sheep. This study demonstrates that multiple echo times from UTE with 3T MRI can provide excellent anatomical detail of osteochondral defects and demonstrate similar features to histology. This work also monitors the location of SPIO-labelled cells for regenerative medicine of the knee with MRI, histology, and Prussian blue staining. With these methods, we show that the SPIOs do not hone to the site of defect but instead aggregate in the location of injection, which suggests that any repair mechanism with this disease model must trigger a secondary process.","2020-05-21","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:36","8451","","1","10","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 10 Place: London Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Web of Science ID: WOS:000546563000001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\AKQ9BGUG\Kaggie et al. - 2020 - Ultra Short Echo Time MRI of Iron-Labelled Mesench.pdf","","","ANGIOGRAPHY; BRAIN; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; IN-VIVO; INTRAARTICULAR INJECTION; KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE TRACKING; MEDICINE; MIGRATION; THERAPY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current non-surgical treatment for OA can only relieve pain without obvious cartilage and subchondral bone repair. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-secreted exosomes have promising therapeutic effects on knee OA, but the efficacy of MSC-exosome therapy is not well determined, and the mechanisms involved are still unclear. In this study, we isolated dental pulp stem cell (DPSC)-derived exosomes by ultracentrifugation and determined the therapeutic effects of a single intra-articular injection of DPSC-derived exosomes in a mice knee OA model. The results showed that the DPSC-derived exosomes effectively improved abnormal subchondral bone remodeling, inhibited the occurrence of bone sclerosis and osteophytes, and alleviated cartilage degradation and synovial inflammation in vivo. Moreover, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) was activated during the progression of OA. Enhanced TRPV4 activation facilitated osteoclast differentiation, and TRPV4 inhibition blocked this process in vitro. DPSC-derived exosomes repressed osteoclast activation in vivo by inhibiting TRPV4 activation. Our findings demonstrated that a topical, single injection of DPSC-derived exosomes is a potential strategy for knee OA treatment, and that the exosomes regulated osteoclast activation by TRPV4 inhibition, which may act as a promising target for clinical OA treatment.","2023-03","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:37","4926","","5","24","","Int.

To enhance the regenerative properties of these materials, they are commonly functionalised with bioactive factors to guide growth within the developing tissue. Extracellular matrix vesicles (EVs) play an important role in facilitating endochondral ossification during long bone development and have recently emerged as important mediators of cell-cell communication coordinating bone regeneration, and thus represent an ideal target to enhance the regenerative properties of synthetic scaffolds. Therefore, in this paper we developed tools and protocols to enable the attachment of MLO-Y4 osteocyte-derived EVs onto electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds for bone repair. Initially, we optimize a method for the functionalization of PCL materials with collagen type-1 and fibronectin, inspired by the behaviour of matrix vesicles during endochondral ossification, and demonstrate that this is an effective method for the adhesion of EVs to the material surface. We then used this functionalization process to attach osteogenic EVs, collected from mechanically stimulated MLO-Y4 osteocytes, to collagen-coated electrospun PCL scaffolds. The EV-functionalized scaffold promoted osteogenic differentiation (measured by increased ALP activity) and mineralization of the matrix. In particular, EV-functionalised scaffolds exhibited significant increases in matrix mineralization particularly at earlier time points compared to uncoated and collagen-coated controls. This approach to matrix-based adhesion of EVs provides a mechanism for incorporating vesicle signalling into polyester scaffolds and demonstrates the potential of osteocyte derived EVs to enhance the rate of bone tissue regeneration.","2021-12","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:37","3621-3635","","12","49","","Ann.

In the present study, (we incorporated MSC-MVs into alginate-polycaprolactone PCL) constructs that had previously been developed for bone tissue engineering applications, with the aim of Promoting angiogenesis and bone regeneration. MSC-MVs were first isolated from the supernatant of rat bone marrow-derived MSCs and characterized by scanning electron microscopic, confocal microscopic, and flow cytometric analyses. The proangiogenic potential of MSC-MVs was demonstrated by the stimulation of tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. MSC-MVs and osteodifferentiated MSCs were then encapsulated with alginate and seeded onto porous three-dimensional printed PCL scaffolds. When combined with osteodifferentiated MSCs, the MV-alginate-PCL constructs enhanced vessel formation and tissue engineered bone regeneration in a nude mouse subcutaneous bone formation model, as demonstrated by micro-computed tomographic, histological, and immunohistochemical analyses.

Fractionation of P. gingivalis cells revealed that cell membrane-associated proteases are responsible for the in vitro degradation of the collagen membranes. In the present study, the specific role of extracellular vesicles and the purified Arg-gingipain enzyme of P. gingivalis in the degradation of three differently cross-linked collagen membranes (Ossix (TM); Bio-Gide (R) and Biomend Extend (TM)) was examined. In addition, the inhibitory effect of antibacterial agents and antibiotics used in local periodontal therapy on the enzymatic degradation was evaluated. The data presented show that while all tested collagen membranes, are prone to lysis by oral bacterial proteases, cross-linked membranes are more resistant to proteolysis. Furthermore, therapeutical concentrations of the antibacterial and antibiotic agents chlorhexidine, cetylpyridiniumchloride, minocycline and doxycycline were found to partially inhibit the enzymatic breakdown of the membranes, while metronidazole had no such effect. These results suggest that the presence of P. gingivalis cells, extracellular vesicles and enzymes in the vicinity of regeneration membranes in the periodontium, may change their physical structure and therefore alter their biological properties. Furthermore, the use of cross-linked collagen membranes and antibacterial agents may significantly inhibit this proteolytic process.","2009-05","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:37","496-502","","5","20","","Clin.

Given the limitations of current stem cell therapy approaches, improvements in immunomodulatory capacity and stem cell differentiation efficacy are needed. In this study, we propose novel strategies to overcome the challenges that remain in hMSC-mediated bone regeneration. We found that PD-1 is highly expressed in osteoblasts, and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis mediated the decreased proinflammatory cytokine expressions in differentiated osteoblasts cocultured with human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs). Moreover, the decrease was attenuated by PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibition. Osteogenic properties including osteogenic gene expression and calcium deposits were increased in osteoblasts cocultured with hADMSCs compared with those that were monocultured. Osteoblasts treated with PD-L1 and exosomes from hADMSCs also exhibited enhanced osteogenic properties, including calcium deposits and osteogenic gene expression. In our cocultured system that mimics the physiological conditions of the bone matrix, the PD-1/PD-L1 axis mediated the increased expression of osteogenic genes, thereby enhancing the osteogenic properties, while the calcium deposits of osteoblasts were maintained. Our results provide the therapeutic potentials and novel roles of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in bone matrix for modulating the bone properties and immunosuppressive potentials that can aid in the prevention of bone diseases via maintaining bone homeostasis.","2022-10","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:37","3152","","19","11","","Cells","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 17 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000866701700001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\J2MES26V\Lee et al. - 2022 - Immunomodulatory Effect and Bone Homeostasis Regul.pdf","","","bone homeostasis; bone regeneration; CELLS; CYTOKINES; hADMSCs; INFLAMMATION; osteoblasts; PD-1; PD-L1 axis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the safety and efficacy of MSC exosomes remain to be validated in a clinically relevant large animal model. Purpose: To validate the safety and efficacy of human MSC exosomes for osteochondral repair in a clinically relevant micropig model. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Bilateral osteochondral defects (6-mm diameter and 1-mm depth) were surgically created in the medial femoral condyles in knees of 12 micropigs. The pigs then received 2-mL intra-articular injections of MSC exosomes and hyaluronic acid (HA) (Exosome+HA) or HA alone after surgery and thereafter at 8 and 15 days. Osteochondral repair was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 15 days and at 2 and 4 months after surgery as well as by macroscopic, histological, biomechanical, and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analyses at 4 months after surgery. Results: Exosome+HA-treated defects demonstrated significantly better MRI scores than HA-treated defects at 15 days and at 2 and 4 months. Additionally, Exosome+HA-treated defects demonstrated functional cartilage and subchondral bone repair, with significantly better macroscopic and histological scores and biomechanical properties (Young modulus and stiffness) than HA-treated defects at 4 months. Micro-CT further showed significantly higher bone volume and trabecular thickness in the subchondral bone of Exosome+HA-treated defects than that of HA-treated defects. Importantly, no adverse response or major systemic alteration was observed in any of the animals. Conclusion: This study shows that the combination of MSC exosomes and HA administered at a clinically acceptable frequency of 3 weekly intra-articular injections can promote functional cartilage and subchondral bone repair, with significantly improved morphological, histological, and biomechanical outcomes in a clinically relevant porcine model.","2022-03","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:37","788-800","","3","50","","Am.

Substances extracted from yams have been reported to promote osteoblast growth in bone regeneration, which prevent weak and brittle bones in osteoporosis. Herein, we describe the beneficial effects of yam-derived exosome-like nanovesicles (YNVs) on promoting differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts for bone regeneration in ovariectomized (OVX)-induced osteoporotic mice. YNVs were successfully isolated and characterized. YNVs stimulate the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblasts with increased bone differentiation markers (OPN, ALP, and COL-I). Interestingly, YNVs do not contain saponins including diosgenin and dioscin known to mainly exert osteogenic activity of yams. Instead, the osteogenic activity of YNVs was revealed to be resulted from activation of the BMP-2/p-p38-dependent Runx2 pathway. As a result, YNVs promote longitudinal bone growth and mineral density of the tibia in the OVX-induced osteoporotic mice in vivo, and these results positively correlate the significant increases in osteoblast-related parameters. In addition, the orally administered YNVs were transported through the GI tract and absorbed through the small intestine. These results showed an excellent systemic biosafety determined by histological analysis and liver/kidney toxicity tests. Taken together, YNVs can serve as a safe and orally effective agent in the treatment of osteoporosis.","2023-03","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:38","184-198","","","355","","J.

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSC)-CM on osteoblasts (OB) and its potential as a therapeutic tool for periodontal regeneration. Human PDLSC were isolated and characterized, and CM from these cells was collected. The presence of exosomes in the culture supernatant was observed by immunofluorescence and by transmission electron microscopy. CM was added to a cultured osteoblastic cell line (Saos-2 cells) and viability (MTT assay) and gene expression analysis (real-time PCR) were examined. A cell line derived from the periodontal ligament and showing all the characteristics of MSC was successfully isolated and characterized. The addition of PDLSC-CM to Saos-2 cells led to an enhancement of their proliferation and an increased expression of some osteoblastic differentiation markers, but this differentiation was not complete. Saos-2 cells were involved in the initial inflammation process by releasing IL-6 and activating COX2. The effects of PDLSC-CM on Saos-2 appear to arise from a cumulative effect of different effective components rather than a few factors present at high levels.","2022-04","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:38","729","","4","14","","Pharmaceutics","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 17 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000785378100001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\X2N2MFYL\Novello et al. - 2022 - Influence of Periodontal Ligament Stem Cell-Derive.pdf","","","bone regeneration; conditioned medium; DIFFERENTIATION; exosomes; EXOSOMES; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; GENES; ISCHEMIA; mesenchymal stem cells; MESENCHYMAL STROMAL CELLS; osteoblasts; periodontal regeneration; REGENERATION; REPAIR; SECRETOME; THERAPY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to investigate miR-26a as a therapeutic cargo to be loaded into bone marrow stromal cell exosomes through a novel immunomodulatory peptide (DP7-C).MethodsAfter transfecting BMSCs with DP7-C as a transfection agent, exosomes were extracted by ultracentrifugation from the culture supernatant of miR-26a-modified BMSCs. We then characterized and identified the engineered exosomes. The effect of the engineered exosomes on osteogenesis was then evaluated in vitro and in vivo, including transwell, wound healing, modified alizarin red staining, western blot, real-time quantitative PCR, and experimental periodontitis assays. Bioinformatics and data analyses were conducted to investigate the role of miR-26a in bone regeneration.ResultsThe DP7-C/miR-26a complex successfully transfected miR-26a into BMSCs and stimulated them to release more than 300 times the amount of exosomes overexpressing miR-26a compared with the Exo(NC) group. Furthermore, exosomes loaded with miR-26a could enhance proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro compared with the Exo(NC) and blank groups. In vivo, the Exo(miR-26a) group inhibited the destruction of periodontitis compared with the Exo(NC) and blank groups, as revealed by HE staining. Micro-CT indicated that treatment of Exo(miR-26a) increased the percent bone volume and the bone mineral density compared with those of the Exo(NC) (P < 0.05) and blank groups (P < 0.001). Target gene analysis indicated that the osteogenic effect of miR-26a is related to the mTOR pathway.ConclusionmiR-26a can be encapsulated into exosomes through DP7-C. Exosomes loaded with miR-26a can promote osteogenesis and inhibit bone loss in experimental periodontitis and serve as the foundation for a novel treatment strategy.","2023-07","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:38","905-919","","7","45","","Biotechnol.

Exosomes are naturally cell-secreted nanovesicles and are lately regraded as an emerging mediator of cellular communication in physiological and pathological conditions. The present study aimed at investigating the complex cellular communications, especially those among the differentiating BMSCs, immune cells (e.g., macrophages), and newly recruited BMSCs via exosome-mediated pathways. Exosomes were first isolated from osteogenically differentiating BMSCs at various stages (Day 0, Day 3, Day 7, and Day 14, respectively). The cellular uptake of isolated exosomes was examined in macrophages and human BMSCs (hBMSCs). The exosomes collected at various osteogenic differentiation stages (0d-exo, 3d-exo, 7d-exo, and 14d-exo) had no effect on the viability of hBMSCs. The uptake of exosomes (0d-exo, 3d-exo, and 7d-exo) significantly decreased proinflammatory-gene expression and the level of an M1 phenotypic marker. Our results then revealed that 3d-exo, 7d-exo, and 14d-exo led to a remarkable increase in mesenchymal stem/stromal cell migration. In addition, 0d-exo significantly promoted the expression of early osteogenic markers, such as alkaline phosphatase and bone morphogenetic protein 2, indicating a pro-osteogenic role of hBMSC-derived exosomes. Collectively, these results suggest that exosomes derived from differentiating mesenchymal stem/stromal cells play a unique osteoimmunomodulatory role in the regulation of bone dynamics.","2019-11","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:38","1978-1991","","11","13","","J.

It is of great prac-tical significance and social value to discover the prevention and treatment strategies for this condition. Exosomes from urine-derived stem cells (Exos) have great potential in promoting bone repair, reconstruc-tion, and regulating bone metabolism. However, they are easily eliminated by macrophages and incapable of targeting the osteolysis zone. In this study, based on macrophage ""homing"" into periprosthetic oste-olysis region and cell membrane encapsulating nanotechnology, exosomes from urine-derived stem cells were encapsulated with macrophage membrane (MM) to prevent periprosthetic osteolysis. We found that macrophage membrane encapsulated urine-derived stem cell-derived exosomes (MM-Exos) can be tar-geted delivery to the osteolysis zone and enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of Exos, which alleviated wear particles-induced calvarial osteolysis. Furthermore, MM-Exos could provide immunological camou-flage and allow the Exos to avoid phagocytosis by macrophages and stimulate cellular uptake by bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs). Therefore, we demonstrated the unique ability of the macrophage membrane as a targeted transport of exosomes from urine-derived stem cells for the prevention and treatment of periprosthetic osteolysis. These biomimetic nanoparticles provided a new therapeutic exo-some delivery system for preventing wear particles-induced osteolysis.Statement of Significance Macrophage membrane encapsulated urine-derived stem cell-derived exosomes (MM-Exos) can be targeted delivery to the osteolysis zone and enhance the therapeutic effect of Exos on peri-prosthetic osteolysis prevention.

Here, we find that abnormally elevated exosomes derived from metabolically impaired liver in T2DM are significantly enriched in the periodontal region and induced pyroptosis of periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs). Mechanistically, fatty acid synthase (Fasn), the main differentially expressed molecule in diabetic exosomes results in ectopic fatty acid synthesis in PDLCs and activates the cleavage of gasdermin D. Depletion of liver Fasn effectively mitigates pyroptosis of PDLCs and alleviates bone loss.

Combination of two or more cell types is one of the strategies to promote bone formation. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may enhance the osteogenic properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and promote bone healing; this study aimed to investigate the possible mechanisms of EPCs on promoting osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.MethodsMSCs and EPCs were isolated and co-cultured in Transwell chambers, the effects of EPCs on the regulation of MSC biological properties were investigated. Real-time PCR array, and western blotting were performed to explore possible signaling pathways involved in osteogenesis. The expression of osteogenesis markers and calcium nodule formation was quantified by qRT-PCR, western blotting, and Alizarin Red staining.ResultsResults showed that MSCs exhibited greater alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and increased calcium mineral deposition significantly when co-cultured with EPCs. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was involved in this process. p38 gene expression and p38 protein phosphorylation levels showed significant upregulation in co-cultured MSCs. Silencing expression of p38 in co-cultured MSCs reduced osteogenic gene expression, protein synthesis, ALP activity, and calcium nodule formation.ConclusionsThese data suggest paracrine signaling from EPCs influences the biological function and promotes MSCs osteogenic differentiation. Activation of the p38MAPK pathway may be the key to enhancing MSCs osteogenic differentiation via indirect interactions with EPCs.","2020-12-11","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:38","537","","1","11","","Stem Cell Res.

We examined osteocyte-derived exosomes with transmission electron microscopy and detected miR-124-3p, Gal-3, and IL-6 expression in exosomes. Saliva Gal-3 was increased in DM compared with controls but decreased in patients with moderate periodontitis and DM compared with those who had moderate periodontitis only. Alveolar bone mass was increased in DM and exacerbated in DM with periodontitis. Gal-3 and Runx2 were both increased in periodontitis and DM compared with controls, but decreased in DM with periodontitis compared with DM alone. MiR-124-3p targeted and inhibited Gal-3 expression in vitro. Osteocytes secreted exosomes carrying miR-124-3p, Gal-3, and IL-6, which were influenced by high glucose. These findings indicate that osteocyte-derived exosomes carrying miR-124-3p may regulate Gal-3 expression of osteoblasts, especially under high-glucose conditions, suggesting a possible mechanism for DM-related alveolar bone pathologies.","2020-11","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:38","14234-14249","","11","34","","Faseb J.","miR-124-3p increases in high glucose induced osteocyte-derived exosomes and regulates galectin-3 expression","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 16 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000564399400001","","","","","ACTIVATION; alveolar bone; CELLS; diabetes mellitus; DIFFERENTIATION; DISEASE; inflammation; INVOLVEMENT; OBESITY; osteoblast; OSTEOBLASTS; saliva; VESICLES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to regenerate articular cartilage, they also have many limitations. Recent studies have found that MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) play an important role in tissue regeneration. The purpose of this study was to verify whether MSC-Exos can enhance the reparative effect of the acellular cartilage extracellular matrix (ACECM) scaffold and to explore the underlying mechanism. The results of in vitro experiments show that human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly MSC-Exos (hWJMSC-Exos) can promote the migration and proliferation of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) and the proliferation of chondrocytes. We also found that hWJMSC-Exos can promote the polarization of macrophages toward the M2 phenotype. The results of a rabbit knee osteochondral defect repair model confirmed that hWJMSC-Exos can enhance the effect of the ACECM scaffold and promote osteochondral regeneration. We demonstrated that hWJMSC-Exos can regulate the microenvironment of the articular cavity using a rat knee joint osteochondral defect model. This effect was mainly manifested in promoting the polarization of macrophages toward the M2 phenotype and inhibiting the inflammatory response, which may be a promoting factor for osteochondral regeneration. In addition, microRNA (miRNA) sequencing confirmed that hWJMSC-Exos contain many miRNAs that can promote the regeneration of hyaline cartilage. We further clarified the role of hWJMSC-Exos in osteochondral regeneration through target gene prediction and pathway enrichment analysis. In summary, this study confirms that hWJMSC-Exos can enhance the effect of the ACECM scaffold and promote osteochondral regeneration.","2021-09","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:39","2711-2728","","9","6","","Bioact.

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. A set of total miRNAs expressed in osteoclast-derived exosomes may configure the specific signature of the bone tissue in the microgravity condition. This study aimed to investigate the miRNA expression profile of osteoclast-derived exosomes in simulated microgravity using next-generation sequencing. Cell culture supernatant of osteoclasts under normal gravity conditions and simulated microgravity conditions were harvested for the extraction of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs. Our results revealed that 116 aberrantly expressed exosomal miRNAs including 29 up-regulated miRNAs and 87 down-regulated miRNAs were found in the simulated microgravity group compared to the normal gravity control group. The candidate target genes and signaling pathways of 15 selected differentially expressed miRNAs were identified via target genes prediction, GO and KEGG analyses. Furthermore, miRNA qPCR assay was performed to validate the RNA sequencing results. Collectively, these analyses provide insight regarding the effects of microgravity in modulating the extracellular miRNA profile through exosomes released from osteoclasts. The selective packaging of miRNA cargo in exosomes under microgravity could facilitate the development of promising and effective targets for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of microgravity-induced osteoporosis.","2019-08","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:39","75-86","","","161","","Acta Astronaut.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 12 Place: Oxford Publisher: Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000473374700008","","","","","BIOLOGY; COMMUNICATION; Exosomes; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; Microgravity; MICRORNAS; miRNA; Next-generation sequencing; OSTEOBLASTS; Osteoclasts; PROMOTES OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; STEM-CELLS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC(AT)s) serve as a special source for cell therapy. Herein, we explored whether exosomes (Exo) derived from MSC(AT)s promote primary gingival wound healing and preventMRONJ. AnMRONJ mice model was constructed using zoledronate (Zol) administration and tooth extraction. Exosomes were collected from the conditioned medium (CM) ofMSC(AT)s (MSC(AT)s-Exo) and locally administered into the tooth sockets. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA)-siRNA was used to knock down the expression of IL-1RA in MSC(AT)s-Exo. Clinical observations, micro-computed tomography (microCT), and histological analysis were used to evaluate the therapeutic effects in vivo. In addition, the effect of exosomes on the biological behavior of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) was evaluated in vitro. MSC(AT)s-Exo accelerated primary gingival wound healing and bone regeneration in tooth sockets and prevented MRONJ. Moreover, MSC(AT)s-Exo increased IL-1RA expression and decreased interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) expression in the gingival tissue. The sequent rescue assay showed that the effects of preventing MRONJ in vivo and improving the migration and collagen synthesis abilities of zoledronate-affected HGFs in vitro were partially impaired in the IL-1RA-deficient exosome group. Our results indicated that MSC(AT)s-Exo might prevent the onset of MRONJ via an IL-1RA-mediated anti-inflammatory effect in the gingiva wound and improve the migration and collagen synthesis abilities of HGFs.","2023-05-12","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:39","8694","","10","24","","Int.

Materials and Methods: Exosomes were isolated and quantified from Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated primary hPDLFs and evaluated by western blotting, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. GW4869 was used to block exosome secretion in conditioned medium (CM). hPDLFs-derived CM, CM containing GW4869 (CM + GW4869) and exosomes were used to stimulate MG-63 cell lines. The expression levels of proinflammatory mediators, osteogenic genes, and osteoclastogenesis-related genes were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, and alkaline phosphatase staining. Results: Exosome-enriched protein and total exosomal protein levels were higher in the LPS-treated group than in the vehicle controls. hPDLFs-derived exosomes were incorporated into MG-63 osteoblasts and slightly upregulated the expression of Interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CM and exosomes inhibited alkaline phosphatase, Collagen-I, Runt-related transcription factor 2, and Osteoprotegerin expression as well as ALP activity, and blocking exosome secretion by GW4869 eliminated the inhibitory effects. Conclusion: These results indicate that LPS-pretreated hPDLFs induce inflammation and inhibit osteogenic activity of osteoblasts through secreting exosomes. This study provides a potential mechanism by which localized periodontal inflammation may influence bone remodeling by release exosomes.","2019-09","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:39","27-34","","","105","","Arch.

Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) offers exceptional biocompatibility and biodegradability but lacks sufficient osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties. This study develops and characterizes SIS coated with hydroxyapatite (SIS-HA) and gelatin methacrylate hydroxyapatite (SIS-Gel-HA) using biomineralization and chemical crosslinking. The impact on periodontal tissue regeneration is assessed by evaluating macrophage immune response and osteogenic differentiation potential of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) in vitro and rat periodontal defects in vivo. The jejunum segment, with the highest collagen type I content, is optimal for SIS preparation. SIS retains collagen fiber structure and bioactive factors. Calcium content is 2.21% in SIS-HA and 2.45% in SIS-Gel-HA, with no significant differences in hydrophilicity, physicochemical properties, protein composition, or biocompatibility among SIS, SIS-HA, SIS-Gel, and SIS-Gel-HA. SIS is found to upregulate M2 marker expression, both SIS-HA and SIS-Gel-HA enhance the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs through the BMP-2/Smad signaling pathway, and SIS-HA demonstrates superior in vitro osteogenic activity. In vivo, SIS-HA and SIS-Gel-HA yield denser, more mature bones with the highest BMP-2 and Smad expression. SIS-HA and SIS-Gel-HA demonstrate enhanced immunity-osteogenesis coupling, representing a promising periodontal tissue regeneration approach. This study presents the preparation of hydroxyapatite-coated small intestinal submucosa and gelatin methacrylate hydroxyapatite for periodontal tissue regeneration.

Since osteocytes are the commander of bone remodeling, attenuating increased osteocyte apoptosis may improve age-related bone loss. Exosomes, derived from mesenchymal stem cells, hold promising potential for cell-free therapy due to multiple abilities, such as promoting proliferation and suppressing apoptosis. We aimed to explore the effect of exosomes derived from adipose mesenchymal stem cell (ADSCs-exo) on osteocyte apoptosis and osteocyte-mediated osteoclastogenesis in vitro. The osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 was used as a model, and apoptosis was induced by hypoxia and serum deprivation (H/SD). Our results showed that ADSCs-exo noticeably reduced H/SD-induced apoptosis in MLO-Y4 cells via upregulating the radio of Bcl-2/Bax, diminishing the production of reactive oxygen species and cytochrome c, and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Additionally, ADSCs-exo lowered the expression of RANKL both at the mRNA and protein levels, as well as the ratio of RANKL/OPG at the gene level. As determined by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, reduced osteoclastogenesis was further validated in bone marrow monocytes cultured under conditioned medium from exosome-treated MLO-Y4. Together, ADSCs-exo could antagonize H/SD induced osteocyte apoptosis and osteocyte-mediated osteoclastogenesis, indicating the therapeutic potential of ADSCs-exo in age-related bone disease.

In addition, large-area infected wounds cause the appearance of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial strains, which pose a major challenge both in clinical and scientific research. Although many stem cell-derived exosomes have been demonstrated to promote skin repair and regeneration, exosomes are seldom applied in the treatment of infective wounds due to the lack of antimicrobial function. In this study, we fabricated an asymmetric wettable dressing with a composite of exosomes and silver nanoparticles (CTS-SF/SA/Ag-Exo dressing) for promoting angiogenesis, nerve repair and infected wound healing. The CTS-SF/SA/Ag-Exo dressing possesses multifunctional properties including broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, promoting wound healing, retaining moisture and maintaining electrolyte balance.

Serum-derived exosomes (SDEs) have been proven to be participated in bone remodeling. However, the molecular changes in SDEs of CPT children and their pathologies have not been elucidated. In this study, SDEs were isolated and purified from CPT patients (CPT-SDEs) associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and normal children (Norm-SDEs). Then we obtained the proteomics profile of SDEs by combining liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and tandem mass tag label-based quantitation. In vitro, the efficacy of SDEs on osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and osteoclastogenesis ability of RAW264.7 cells were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and cytochemical staining. In vivo, we used micro-CT to assess cortical bone mass and trabecular microstructures to reflect the influence of SDEs on bone remodeling after injection into the tail vein of rats. Based on proteomics analysis, 410 differentially expressed proteins, including 289 downregulated proteins and 121 upregulated proteins, were identified in the CPT-SDEs. These proteins have multiple biological functions associated with cellular metabolic processes, catalytic activity, and protein binding, which are important for cell differentiation and proliferation. In vitro, CPT-SDEs decreased the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and promoted the osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 cells. Injection of CPT-SDEs into the tail vein for two months resulted in bone loss in rats, as indicated by the decrease in trabecular and cortical bone mass. Our findings demonstrated the differences in proteins in SDEs between normal and CPT children with NF1. These differentially expressed proteins in CPT-SDEs contributed to deteriorating trabecular bone microstructures by inhibiting bone formation and stimulating bone resorption.","2021-01","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:40","130-141","","2","246","","Exp.

However, existing exosome (Exo) delivery strategies cannot reach the angiogenesis phase following bone injury. To that end, an enzyme-sensitive Exo delivery material that responds to neovessel formation during the angiogenesis phase was designed in the present study to achieve spatiotemporally controlled Exo re-lease. Herein, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) was found to be highly expressed in neovascularized bone; as a result, we proposed an injectable MMP1-sensitive hydrogel microspheres (KGE) made using a microfluidic chip prepared by mixing self-assembling peptide (KLDL-MMP1), GelMA, and BMSC-Exos. The results revealed that KGE microspheres had a uniform diameter of 50-70 mu m, ideal for minimally invasive injection and could release exosomes in response to MMP1 expression. In vitro experiments demonstrated that KGE had less cytotoxicity and could promote the migration and osteodifferentiation of BMSCs. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that KGE could promote bone repair during an-giogenesis by recruiting CD90+ stem cells via neovessels. Collectively, our results suggest that injectable enzyme-responsive KGE microspheres could be a promising Exo-secreting material for accelerating neo-vascularized bone healing.Statement of significance Exosomes can spread through blood vessels and activate stem cells to participate in bone repair, but under normal circumstances, exosomes lacking sustained-release delivery materials cannot be maintained until the angiogenesis phase. In this study, we found that MMP1 was highly expressed in neovascularized bone, then we proposed an MMP1-sensitive injectable microsphere that carries exosomes and responds temporally and spatially to neovascularization, which maximizes the ability of exosomes to recruit stem cells. Different from previous strategies that focus on promoting angiogenesis to accelerate bone healing, this is a brand new delivery strategy that is stimuli-responsive to neovessel formation. In addition, the preparation of self-assembled peptide microspheres by a microfluidic chip is also proposed for the first time.(c) 2023 The Authors.

Within the scope of clinical research in the field of regenerative medicine, this work represents the potential of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (hPDLFs)-derived exosomes (hPDLFs-Exo) as a cell-free regenerative therapy tool in the repair of calvarial bone damage by utilizing their cell-instructive potential. To this aim, isolated hPDLFs-Exo were integrated with UV-responsive gelatine methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogels, which enable the development of a robust and biologically active platform for the regeneration of a critical-sized calvarial defect at middle-age rats (6-months old). In vitro tests revealed that human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSC) on GelMA/hPDLFs-Exo hydrogels begin to up-regulate RUX2, ALP, and OSP expressions, that support the hypothesis of growth factors-free induction of osteogenic differentiation in hMSCs. In vivo results obtained by micro-computed tomography (& mu;-CT), histochemistry, and gene expression analyses confirmed that rats treated with GelMA/hPDLFs-Exo posed higher new bone mineralization compared to the negative controls. Obtained results highlighted the potential of GelMA/hPDLFs-Exo hydrogel to attract endogenous stem cells and instruct into osteogenesis, providing bone damage repair.

Compression stress also stimulates angiogenesis, which is essential for osteoclastogenesis. However, the effects of osteoclastogenesis induced by compression on angiogenesis are poorly understood. In vivo, we found the markers of angiogenesis increased during orthodontic bone remodeling. In vitro, osteoclast-derived exosomes increased proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), as well as expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and CD31. The promotive effects of exosomes derived from compressed osteoclasts were greater than those derived from osteoclasts without compression. Next, we analyzed changes in the microRNA transcriptome after compression stress and focused on microRNA146a-5p (miR-146a), which was significantly decreased by compression. Transfection of an inhibitor of miR-146a stimulated angiogenesis of HUVECs while miR-146a mimics repressed angiogenesis. Adiponectin (ADP) was confirmed to be a target of miR-146a by dual luciferase reporter assay. In HUVECs treated with exosomes, we detected increased ADP which promoted angiogenesis. Knockdown of ADP in HUVECs reduced the promotive effects of exosomes. Our results demonstrate that the decreased miR-146a observed in osteoclasts after compression promotes angiogenesis by targeting ADP, suggesting a novel method to interfere with bone remodeling induced by compression stress.","2022-01","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:40","151-166","","1","65","","Sci.

There are many approaches that have been used to improve bone fracture healing. Recently, exosomes have been regarded as promising medical biomaterials for improving fracture healing. However, whether exosomes derived from adipose stem cells can promote bone fracture healing in diabetes mellitus remains unclear. In this study, adipose stem cells (ASCs) and exosomes derived from adipose stem cells (ASCs-exos) are isolated and identified. Additionally, we evaluate the in vitro and in vivo effects of ASCs-exos on the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and bone repair and the regeneration in a rat model of nonunion via Western blotting, immunofluorescence assay, ALP staining, alizarin red staining, radiographic examination and histological analysis. Compared with controls, ASCs-exos promoted BMSC osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, the results of Western blotting, radiographic examination and histological analysis show that ASCs-exos improve the ability for fracture repair in the rat model of nonunion bone fracture healing. Moreover, our results further proved that ASCs-exos play a role in activating the Wnt3a/beta-catenin signaling pathway, which facilitates the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. All these results show that ASCs-exos enhance the osteogenic potential of BMSCs by activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, and also facilitate the ability for bone repair and regeneration in vivo, which provides a novel direction for fracture nonunion in diabetes mellitus treatment.","2023-03","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:40","4852","","5","24","","Int.

The current standard care is ablative surgery of malignant neoplasm, followed by tongue reconstruction with free flap. However, such reconstructive modalities with postsurgery radiotherapy or chemotherapy can hardly support the functional recovery of the tongue-particularly, functional taste bud regeneration-in reconstructed areas, thus seriously affecting patients' prognosis and life quality. Using a critical-sized tongue defect model in rats, we show that combinatory transplantation of small intestinal submucosa-extracellular matrix (SIS-ECM) with gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) or their derivative exosomes promoted tongue lingual papillae recovery and taste bud regeneration as evidenced by increased expression of CK14, CK8, and markers for type I, II, and III taste bud cells (NTPdase 2, PLC-beta 2, and AADC, respectively). In addition, our results indicate that GMSCs or their derivative exosomes could increase BDNF expression, a growth factor that plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of epithelial basal progenitor cells into taste bud cells. Meanwhile, we showed an elevated expression level of Shh-which is essential for development, homeostasis, and maintenance of the taste bud organ-in wounded areas of the tongue among animals treated with GMSC/SIS-ECM or exosome/SIS-ECM as compared with SIS-ECM control. Moreover, our data show that GMSCs or their derivative exosomes promoted innervation of regenerated taste buds, as evidenced by elevated expressions of neurofilament and P2X(3) at the injury areas. Together, our findings indicate that GMSC/SIS-ECM and exosome/SIS-ECM constructs can facilitate taste bud regeneration and reinnervation with promising potential application in postsurgery tongue reconstruction of patients with tongue cancer.","2019-02","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:40","225-233","","2","98","","J.

Although immune cells have been identified in mouse bone marrow, variations in their numbers and type during the fracture healing process remain poorly defined. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing was used to identify immune cells in fracture tissues, including neutrophils, monocytes, T cells, B cells, and plasma cells. The number of B cells decreased significantly in the early stage of fracture healing. Furthermore, B cells in mice fracture models decreased significantly during the epiphyseal phase and then gradually returned to normal during the epiphyseal transformation phase of fracture healing. The B-cell pattern was opposite to that of bone formation and resorption activities. Notably, B-cell-derived exosomes inhibited bone homeostasis in fracture healing. In humans, a decrease in the number of B cells during the epiphyseal phase stimulated fracture healing. Then, as the numbers of osteoblasts increased during the callus reconstruction stage, the number of B cells gradually recovered, which reduced additional bone regeneration. Thus, B cells are key regulators of fracture healing and inhibit excessive bone regeneration by producing multiple osteoblast inhibitors.","2021-11-08","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:40","666140","","","12","","Front.

Biofabrication strategies enable the creation of scaffolds with specific microstructural environments and biological components. Lithium (Li) has been reported to exhibit antiinflammatory, osteogenic, and chondrogenic properties by promoting several intracellular signaling pathways. Currently, research focuses on fabricating scaffolds with simultaneous dual bioactivities to enhance osteochondral regeneration. In this study, we modified the surface of calcium silicate (CS) scaffolds with Li using a simple immersion technique and evaluated their capabilities for bone regeneration. The results showed that Li ions could be easily coated onto the surfaces of CS scaffolds without affecting the microstructural properties of CS itself. Furthermore, the modifications did not affect the printing capabilities of the CS, and porous scaffolds could be fabricated via extrusion. Moreover, the presence of Li improved the surface roughness and hydrophilicity, thus leading to enhanced secretion of osteochondral-related regeneration factors, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and collagen II (Col II) proteins. Subsequent in vivo studies, including histological and micro-CT analyses, confirmed that the Li-modified CS scaffolds promoted osteochondral regeneration. The transcriptome analysis suggested that the enhanced osteochondrogenic capabilities of our scaffolds were influenced by paracrine exosomes. We hope this study will inspire further research on osteochondral regeneration.","2023-10","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:40","100728","","","22","","Mater.

The underlying mechanisms were also explored. Methods: EPCs were isolated from bone marrow mononuclear cells. EPC-MVs were collected from EPCs cultured medium. The lentivirus was used to induce miR-126 over-expression in EPCs and EPC-MVs. miR-126 expression was detected by qRT-PCR. The proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation abilities of osteoblast cells MC3T3-E1 were analysed in the presence or absence of EPC-MVs or miR-126 overexpressed EPC-MVs (EPC-MVs-miR126). The proteins of Erk1/2 and Bcl-2 were analysed by western blot. Erk1/2 inhibitor was used for pathway exploration. Results: EPC-MVs reduced apoptosis and promoted proliferation and migration of MC3T3-E1 cells, which could be enhanced by miR-126 enrichment (p< 0.05). Neither EPC-MVs nor EPC-MVs-miR126 had an effect on MC3T3-E1 cell osteogenic differentiation (p> 0.05). EPC-MVs-miR126 had better effects than EPC-MVs on upregulating the expressions of p-Erk1/2 and Bcl-2, which were abolished by Erk1/2 inhibitor.

Dexamethasone (DXM) is widely accepted as an important regulator in tailoring the differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, the effect of DXM on the paracrine signaling of MSCs remains unknown. To this point, we aimed to explore the role of DXM in regulating the paracrine activity of MSCs through evaluating the release and function of MSC-MVs, based on their physicochemical characteristics and support on osteogenic response. Results showed that DXM had no evident impact on the release of MSC-MVs but played a pivotal role in regulating the function of MSC-MVs. MVs obtained from the DXM-stimulated MSCs (DXM-MVs) increased MC3T3 cell proliferation and migration and upregulated Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteopontin (OPN) expression. The repair efficiency of DXM-MVs for femur defects was further investigated in an established rat model. It was found that DXM-MVs accelerated the healing process of bone formation in the defect area. Thus, we conclude that using DXM as stimuli to obtain functional MSCs-MVs could become a valuable tool for promoting bone regeneration.","2018","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:41","7231739","","","2018","","Stem Cells Int.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 12 Place: London Publisher: Hindawi Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000431295600001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\FZZVTJWU\Zhao et al. - 2018 - Dexamethasone-Activated MSCs Release MVs for Stimu.pdf","","","DIFFERENTIATION; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; GENE-EXPRESSION; GLUCOCORTICOIDS; HUMAN BONE-MARROW; IN-VITRO; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; MICROPARTICLES; STROMAL CELLS; UP-REGULATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasing evidence has confirmed that the communication between osteoclast and osteoblast through secreting exosomes and transferring miRNAs. It has been reported that mineralized osteoblasts release exosomes containing more miR-503-3p. However, the roles and molecular mechanisms of osteoblast exosomesderived miR-503-3p in osteoclast differentiation remain elusive. Here, we isolated exosomes from the supernatant of osteoblasts and identified the exosome characterization through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and western blot assay. In addition, we found that exosomes and miR-503-3p secreted by osteoblasts inhibited the differentiation of osteoclast progenitor cells. Meanwhile, we found that Hpse (heparanase gene) was a target gene of miR-503-3p and miR-503-3p inhibited the osteoclast differentiation through downregulating the expression of Hpse.

Purpose: To assess the effect of exosomes derived from human urine-derived stem cells (hUSCs) overexpressing miR-140-5p (miR means microRNA) on KOA in an in vitro interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta)-induced osteoarthritis (OA) model and an in vivo rat KOA model. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Exosomes derived from hUSCs (hUSC-Exos) were isolated and validated. The hUSCs were transfected with miR-140s using lentivirus, and exosomes secreted from such cells (hUSC-140-Exos) were collected. The roles of hUSC-Exos and hUSC-140-Exos in protecting chondrocytes against IL-1 beta treatment were compared by analyzing the proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) in chondrocytes. After vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) was identified as a target of miR-140, the mechanism by which VEGFA can mediate the beneficial effect of miR-140 on OA was investigated using small interfering RNA transfection or chemical drugs. The expression of VEGFA in cartilage and synovial fluid from patients with KOA was measured and compared with that of healthy controls. Surgery for anterior cruciate ligament transection and destabilization of the medial meniscus were performed on the knee joints of Sprague-Dawley rats to establish an animal model of OA, and intra-articular (IA) injection of hUSC-Exos or hUSC-140-Exos was conducted at 4 to 8 weeks after the surgery. Cartilage regeneration and subchondral bone remodeling were evaluated through histological staining and micro-computed tomography analysis. Results: Proliferation and migration ability were enhanced and apoptosis was inhibited in chondrocytes treated with IL-1 beta via hUSC-Exos, with the side effect of decreased ECM secretion. hUSC-140-Exos not only retained the advantages of hUSC-Exos but also increased the secretion of ECM by targeting VEGFA, including collagen II and aggrecan. Increased expression of VEGFA during the progression of KOA was also confirmed in cartilage and synovial fluid samples obtained from patients with OA. In the rat OA model, IA injection of hUSC-140-Exos enhanced cartilage regeneration and subchondral bone remodeling. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated the superiority of hUSC-Exos overexpressing miR-140-5p for treating OA compared with the hUSC-Exos. The effect of hUSC-140-Exos for suppressing the progression of KOA is in part mediated by VEGFA.","2022-03","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:41","1088-1105","","4","50","","Am.

This study aims to investigate the efficacy of exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on the pathogenesis and behavioral signs of LBP in the LFJ OA mouse model. The pathogenetic change in cartilage and aberrant nerve invasion in the subchondral bone of LFJ in a mouse model after treatment with BMSC-exosomes was evaluated. BMSC-exosomes could relieve pain via abrogation of aberrant CGRP-positive nerve and abnormal H-type vessel formation in the subchondral bone of LFJ. Moreover, BMSC-exosomes attenuated cartilage degeneration and inhibited tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase expression and RANKL-RANK-TRAF6 signaling activation to facilitate subchondral bone remodeling. These results indicated that BMSC-exosomes could relive behavioral signs of LBP and pathological processes in LFJ OA.

In the present study, ablation of osteocytes in mice [osteocyte-less (OL)] was used to examine the microRNA (miRNA) levels of plasma-circulating exosomes. In order to investigate the function of osteocyte-secreted exosomes, exosomes derived from MLO-Y4 cells were extracted and their miRNA expression levels were examined using miRNA array analysis and deep sequencing. Comparison of miRNA expression levels between plasma exosomes from OL mouse plasma and MLO-Y4-derived exosomes revealed that decreases in the number of miRNAs from exosomes circulating in the OL mouse plasma may be caused by a decrease in secretion of exosomes from osteocytes. These results suggest that osteocytes secrete exosomes containing characterized miRNAs and then circulate in the blood, and may thus transfer their components, including miRNAs, to recipient cells where they function as signaling molecules in other organs and/ or tissues to regulate biological responses.","2017-02","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:41","223-231","","2","6","","Biomed.

Our previous research demonstrated that BMSCs-ExoTGF-131 attenuated cartilage damage in osteoarthritis (OA) rats through carrying highly expressed miR-135b. Methods: The bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were isolated from mouse bone marrow, and BMSCderived exosomes (BMSCs-Exo) were isolated from BMSCs.

Exosomes (Exo) are thought to play a part in bone regeneration and healing as key players in cell-to-cell contact. The object of this work was to determine whether exosomes derived from DO and BF serum could stimulate the Osteogenic Differentiation in these two processes, and if so, which genes could be involved. Methods The osteogenesis in DO-gap or BF-gap was evaluated using radiographic analysis and histological analysis. On the 14th postoperative day, DO-Exos and BF-Exos were isolated and cocultured with the jaw of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (JBMMSCs). Proliferation, migration and osteogenic differentiation of JBMMSCs were ascertained, after which exosomes RNA-seq was performed to identify the relevant gene. Results Radiographic and histological analyses manifested that osteogenesis was remarkably accelerated in DO-gap in comparison with BF-gap. Both of the two types of Exos were taken up by JBMMSCs, and their migration and osteogenic differentiation were also seen to improve. However, the proliferation showed no significant difference. Finally, exosome RNA-seq revealed that the lncRNA MSTRG.532277.1 and the mRNA F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 14(FBXL14) may play a key role in DO. Conclusions Our findings suggest that exosomes from serum exert a critical effect on the rapid osteogenesis in DO. This promoting effect might have relevance with the co-expression of MSTRG.532277.1 and FBXL14. On the whole, these findings provide new insights into bone regeneration, thereby outlining possible therapeutic targets for clinical intervention.","2022-05-28","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","2024-01-26 18:25:42","291","","1","17","","J.

The OPN protein is cleaved, but it is unclear how full-length (FL)-OPN or its cleaved form perform their biological activities in target cells. We, therefore, performed the molecular characterization of OPN in exosomes (Exo). The Exo were isolated from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 macrophages. The Exo were also isolated from PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages. The Exo were identified using the qNano multiple analyzer (diameter 59-315 nm) and western blotting with a CD9 antibody. LPS-stimulated cells produced more particles than non-stimulated cells. The presence of the FL or the cleaved form of OPN was confirmed using western blot analysis. A mixture of FL and cleaved OPN was also measured using an ELISA system (Ud-OPN) and their presence in the Exo was confirmed. Ud/FL ratios became low after LPS stimulation, indicating the enhanced encapsulation of FL-OPN in the Exo by LPS. These findings suggest that LPS stimulation of human macrophages facilitates the synthesis of FL-OPN, which is cleaved in cells or the Exo after release. These findings indicate that Exo is a suitable vehicle to transfer OPN to the target cells.","2020-11","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:33","8490","","22","21","","Int.

Macrophages play a key role in the process of fracture healing by undergoing polarization into either M1 or M2 subtypes, which respectively exhibit pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory functions. Therefore, modulation of macro-phage polarization to the M2 subtype is beneficial for fracture healing. Exosomes perform an important role in improving the osteoimmune microenvironment due to their extremely low immunogenicity and high bioactivity. In this study, we extracted the M2-exosomes and used them to intervene the bone repair in diabetic fractures. The results showed that M2-exosomes significantly modulate the osteoimmune microenvironment by decreasing the proportion of M1 macrophages, thereby accelerating diabetic fracture healing. We further confirmed that M2-exosomes induced the conversion of M1 macrophages into M2 macrophages by stimulating the PI3K/AKT pathway.

Our previous studies have clarified the indirect influence of Ti surface topography in the osteogenic differentiation of bm-MSCs through modulating macrophage polarization.

As the immune regulatory properties of MSCs have become increasingly prominent, whether bm-MSCs could also play an immunomodulatory role on macrophages under the influence of Ti surface topography is unclear. To further illuminate the communications between bm-MSCs and macrophages, the bm-MSCs inoculated on Ti with nanoporous topography were indirectly co-cultured with macrophages, and by blocking exosome secretion or extracting the purified exosomes to induce independently, we bidirectionally confirmed that under the influence of TiO2 nanoporous topography with 80-100 nm tube diameters, bm-MSCs can exert immunomodulatory effects through exosome-mediated paracrine actions and induce M1 polarization of macrophages, adversely affecting the osteogenic microenvironment around the implant.

The balance between osteogenesis and adipogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) plays a major role in the process of bone formation. Recently, intercellular communication between bone cells and surrounding cells has been gradually recognized, and macrophages on the surface of bone have been proven to regulate bone metabolism. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Recent studies have indicated that exosomes are vital messengers for cell-cell communication in various biological processes. In this experiment, we found that exosomes derived from M2 macrophages (M2D-Exos) could inhibit adipogenesis and promote osteogenesis of BMSCs. M2D-Exo intervention increased the expression of miR-690, IRS-1, and TAZ in BMSCs. Additionally, miR-690 knockdown in M2 macrophages with a miR-690 inhibitor partially counteracted the effect of M2D-Exos on BMSC differentiation and the upregulation of IRS-1 and TAZ expression. Taken together, the results of our study indicate that exosomes isolated from M2 macrophages could facilitate osteogenesis and reduce adipogenesis through the miR-690/IRS-1/TAZ axis and might be a therapeutic tool for bone loss diseases.","2021-07-06","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:34","680328","","","12","","Front.

Studies have suggested that umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (uMSCs) could promote angiogenesis. This study investigated whether exosomes derived from uMSCs (uMSC-Exos) could enhance fracture healing as primary factors by promoting angiogenesis. Materials and Methods uMSCs were obtained to isolate uMSC-Exos by ultrafiltration, with exosomes from human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) being used as control groups. NanoSight, laser light scattering spectrometer, transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting were used to identify exosomes. Next, uMSC-Exos combined with hydrogel were transplanted into the fracture site in a rat model of femoral fracture. Bone healing processes were monitored and evaluated by radiographic methods on days 7, 14, 21 and 31 after surgery; angiogenesis of the fracture sites was assessed by radiographic and histological strategies on post-operative day 14. In vitro, the expression levels of osteogenesis- or angiogenesis-related genes after being cultured with uMSC-Exos were identified by qRT-PCR. The internalization ability of exosomes was determined using the PKH67 assay. Cell cycle analysis, EdU incorporation and immunofluorescence staining, scratch wound assay and tube formation analysis were also used to determine the altered abilities of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) administered with uMSC-Exos in proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. Finally, to further explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, specific RNA inhibitors or siRNAs were used, and the subsequent effects were observed. Results uMSC-Exos had a diameter of approximately 100 nm, were spherical, meanwhile expressing CD9, CD63 and CD81. Transplantation of uMSC-Exos markedly enhanced angiogenesis and bone healing processes in a rat model of femoral fracture. In vitro, other than enhancing osteogenic differentiation, uMSC-Exos increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha). uMSC-Exos were taken up by HUVECs and enhanced their proliferation, migration and tube formation. Finally, by using specific RNA inhibitors or siRNAs, it has been confirmed that HIF-1 alpha played an important role in the uMSC-Exos-induced VEGF expression, pro-angiogenesis and enhanced fracture repair, which may be one of the underlying mechanisms. Conclusions These results revealed a novel role of exosomes in uMSC-mediated therapy and suggested that implanted uMSC-Exos may represent a crucial clinical strategy to accelerate fracture healing via the promotion of angiogenesis. HIF-1 alpha played an important role in this process.","2019-03","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:34","e12570","","2","52","","Cell Prolif.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 12 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000463046500001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\HKCD2GNG\Zhang et al. - 2019 - Exosomes from human umbilical cord mesenchymal ste.pdf","","","angiogenesis; BONE REGENERATION; CONTRIBUTES; DIFFERENTIATION; ENDOMETRIUM; exosomes; EXPRESSION; FIBROBLASTS; fracture healing; GROWTH-FACTOR; HIF-1 alpha; MEDIATED TRANSFER; OSTEOGENESIS; STROMAL CELLS; umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Magnesium and its alloys are promising biodegradable bone implant materials and can affect immunoregulation of macrophages by the degradation products (magnesium ions). Nevertheless, the mechanism of macrophage-derived exosomes stimulated by Mg ions in immunoregulation is still not well understood. Herein, 10-50 mM magnesium ions are shown to inhibit the macrophage viability and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, but a high concentration results in macrophage apoptosis. The exosomes secreted by macrophages from magnesium ion stimulation inhibit angiogenesis of endothelial cells, as manifested by the suppressed cell viability, proliferation, migration, and tube formation, which arise at least partially from exosome-mediated downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide and the vascular endothelial growth factor. The findings reported in this paper suggest that the bio-functionality of biodegradable magnesium alloys must be considered from the perspective of immunoregulation of macrophage-derived exosomes.

Considering the limited sources and bone regeneration efficiency of human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs), we explored whether exosomes secreted by stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED-exo) could improve the pluripotency and regenerative potential of hPDLCs. Methods and Materials In hPDLCs, cell proliferation, migration, cell cycle, apoptosis, and osteogenic differentiation were detected after cells were exposed to SHED-exo (SHED-exo group), blank (control group), or control supernatant without exo (Csup group), via CCK-8, scratch analysis, flow cytometric, real-time PCR, and so on. Exosomes sequencing was performed to compare and analyze miRNAs contented in SHED-exo and hPDLC-exo. Results As compared to control or Csup, SHED-exo significantly increased migration, apoptosis, and proliferation, promoted cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase in hPDLCs, and enhanced Runx2 expression and mineralization. In addition, it may be explained by the significant differences in miRNA contented in SHED-exo and hPDLC-exo.

As an essential component of the host immunity, macrophages are highly plastic and play a crucial role in inflammatory response. An appropriate and timely transition from proinflammatory (M1) to anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages is indispensable for treating periodontitis. As M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (M2-exos) can actively target inflammatory sites and modulate immune microenvironments, M2-exos can effectively treat periodontitis. Excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and unfolded protein response (UPR) are highly destructive pathological characteristics during inflammatory periodontal bone loss. Although melatonin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, studies focusing on melatonin ER stress modulation remain limited. This study fabricates engineered M2-exos loading with melatonin (Mel@M2-exos) for treating periodontitis. As a result, M2-exos drive an appropriate and timely macrophage reprogramming from M1 to M2 type, which resolves chronic inflammation and accelerated periodontal healing. Melatonin released from Mel@M2-exos rescues the osteogenic and cementogenic differentiation capacity in inflammatory human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) by reducing excessive ER stress and UPR. Injectable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels with sustained-release Mel@M2-exos accelerate periodontal bone regeneration in rats with ligation-induced periodontitis. Taken together, melatonin engineering M2 macrophage-derived exosomes are promising candidates for inflammatory periodontal tissue regeneration.","2023-09-26","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:34","2302029","","27","10","","Adv.

Whether the communication between osteoclasts and osteoblasts is influenced by orthodontic compression stress requires further clarification. In this study, osteoclasts were differentiated for 10 days. On day 4 of differentiation, the number of pre-osteoclasts peaked, as determined by the increased expression of RANK and the number of multinucleated cells. After 24 h of compression stress loading, on day 4, the number of osteoclasts increased, and the optimal magnitude of stress to promote osteoclastogenesis was determined as 1 g/cm(2). Moreover, the results of RNA-sequencing analysis showed that the miRNA expression profile changed markedly after compression loading and that many of the altered miRNAs were associated with cell communication functions. A series of indirect co-culture experiments showed an inhibitory effect of osteoclasts on osteoblast differentiation, especially after compression. Next, we added osteoclast-derived exosomes to hPDLSCs during osteoblast differentiation. Exosomes derived from osteoclasts under compression (cEXO) showed a greater inhibitory effect on osteoblast differentiation, compared to exosomes from osteoclasts without compression (EXO). Therefore, we analyzed differentially expressed miRNAs associated with bone development functions in exosomes: miR-223-5p and miR-181a-5p were downregulated, whereas miR-133a-3p, miR-203a-3p, miR-106a-5p, and miR-331-3p were upregulated; these altered expressions may explain the enhanced inhibitory effect of compression stress.","2021","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:35","427-444","","2","45","","Biocell","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 18 Place: Henderson Publisher: Tech Science Press Web of Science ID: WOS:000620348800016","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\V2ZCMCDA\Wang et al. - 2021 - Exosomes derived from osteoclasts under compressio.pdf","","","ALVEOLAR BONE; COCULTURE; Compression stress; Exosome; EXPRESSION; INDUCED OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; INFLAMMATION; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; microRNA; MICRORNA; Osteoclastogenesis; Osteogenesis; PATHWAYS; PERIODONTAL-LIGAMENT; PRECURSORS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current efforts mainly focus on alveolar bone regeneration rather than cementum regeneration, and rarely take Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), the keystone pathogen responsible for periodontal tissue destruction, into consideration. Though M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (M2-EXO) show promise in tissue regeneration, the exosome-producing M2 macrophages are induced by exogenous cytokines with transitory and unstable effects, restricting the regeneration potential of M2-EXO. Here, exosomes derived from genetically engineered M2-like macrophages are constructed by silencing of casein kinase 2 interacting protein-1 (Ckip-1), a versatile player involved in various biological processes. Ckip-1 silencing is proved to be an effective gene regulation strategy to obtain permanent M2-like macrophages with mineralization-promoting effect. Further, exosomes derived from Ckip-1-silenced macrophages (sh-Ckip-1-EXO) rescue Pgsuppressed cementoblast mineralization and cementogenesis. Mechanismly, sh-Ckip-1-EXO delivers Let-7f-5p targeting and silencing Ckip-1, a negative regulator also for cementum formation and cementoblast mineralization. More deeply, downregulation of Ckip-1 in cementoblasts by exosomal Let-7f-5p activates PGC-1 alpha-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis.

Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes can induce naive stem cells to differentiate through the osteogenic lineage. In the present study, exosomes derived from 3T3L1 preadipocytes (3T3L1-exo) were purified and characterized. The effects and potential mechanisms of 3T3L1-exo on 3T3L1 cell ossification were examined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, electron microscopy, RNA sequencing and histological analysis. The current study confirmed that 3T3L1-exo enhanced 3T3L1 preadipocyte osteogenic differentiation, as revealed by upregulation of osteogenic differentiation-associated genes and increased Alizarin Red staining. Furthermore, the microRNA (miR) expression profiles of 3T3L1-exo and 3T3L1 preadipocytes were sequenced and compared. The results of a further analysis demonstrated that miR-223 expression was reduced in 3T3L1 preadipocytes stimulated by 3T3L1-exo compared with in unstimulated cells. This finding suggested that 3T3L1-exo promoted 3T3L1 bone formation by decreasing miR-223 through a competitive mechanism, another miRNA, or another factor. The mechanism by which miR-223 is decreased warrants further investigation. In conclusion, the application of 3T3L1-exo may be useful for investigating preadipocyte-induced bone regeneration.","2019-02","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:35","951-958","","2","19","","Mol.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot were carried out to detect the expressions of osteogenic differentiation-related factors in cells. Further, PDLSCs were treated with P.g-LPS or inhibitors. The expression of NF-kappa B pathway-related factors as well as of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway-related factors were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot.Results: GMSC-Exo treatment promoted the expression of osteogenic differentiation-related factors within PDLSCs in both normal and inflammatory environments. Further investigations showed that GMSC-Exo could also inhibit the P.g-LPS-induced activation of the NF-kappa B pathway, leading to the up-regulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. When the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling was blocked, the inhibitory effect of GMSC-Exo on the NF-kappa B pathway was abolished.Conclusions: GMSC-Exo could promote the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. There could be mutually exclusive regulatory roles between the NF-kappa B and Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathways in a periodontal inflammatory environment. GMSC-Exo exhibited an effective cross-regulation ability for both pathways.","2023-03-05","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:35","","","","","","J. Clin.

In an aged so-ciety with increased life expectancy, the incidence rate of osteoporosis is also rapidly increasing. Inadequate nutrition may negatively influence bone metabolism. Recently, many studies have investigated the function-ality of milk-derived exosomes, which play important roles in cell-to-cell communication. However, there are few reports of how milk-derived exosomes influence osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Here, we determined whether bovine colostrum-derived exo-somes promote anti-osteoporosis in vitro and in vivo. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-stained cells were significantly inhibited in Raw264.7 cells treated with exosomes, indicating reduced osteoclast differentiation. We induced osteoporosis in mice using glucocorticoid pellets after orally administering exosomes for 2 mo. Interestingly, the bone mineral density of exosome-fed mouse groups was significantly improved compared with the glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis group without exosome treatment. In addition, Lactobacil-lus were decreased in the gut microbiota community of osteoporosis-induced mice, but the gut microbiota community composition was effectively restored by exo-some intake. Taken together, we propose that exosomes isolated from bovine colostrum could be a potential candidate for osteoporosis prevention, bone remodeling improvement, and inhibition of bone resorption. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a protective effect of milk exosomes against osteoporosis has been demonstrated in vivo. Our results strongly suggest that bovine colostrum exosomes might be used as a prophylaxis to prevent the onset of osteoporosis. Indeed, our results offer promising alternative strategies in the nutritional management of age-related bone complications.","2020-09","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:35","7752-7760","","9","103","","J.

The aim of this study was to identify the presence of exosomes in CME and to determine the osteogenic effect of CME exosomes on MG63 cells. Methods Exosomes were isolated from human placenta CME using the ExoQuick-TC solution and were characterized. The activity and deposition of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on MG63 cells cultured with or without exosomes in osteogenic induction medium (OIM) were determined. Human amniotic membrane extracts (AME) were used as controls as they had not affected the osteogenic differentiation of MG63 cells in our previous study. Results Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that exosomes isolated from CME and AME (CME-Exo and AME-Exo, respectively) had a cup-shaped structure. NanoSight (TM) particle tracking analysis (NTA) confirmed that the size of these exosomes was 100-150 nm. In vitro osteogenic experiments demonstrated that the exosomes from CME, but not those from AME, presented increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and resulted in the mineralization of MG63 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion Exosomes were identified in CME and AME from the human placenta. Further, the exosomes from CME were found to be capable of promoting osteogenic differentiation, suggesting that exosomes are a key component of CME that stimulate the osteogenesis of human osteoblast-like cells. CME exosomes can be developed as promising therapeutic candidates for bone regeneration.","2021-05-06","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:35","16","","1","25","","Biomater.

Consequently, bone regeneration using mesenchymal stem cells and tissue engineering strategies is one of the most widely researched fields in regenerative medicine. Recent scientific consensus indicates that a biomimetic approach is required to achieve proper regeneration of any tissue. Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted by cells that act as messengers that influence cell fate. Although exosomal function has been studied with respect to cancer and immunology, the role of exosomes as inducers of stem cell differentiation has not been explored. We hypothesized that exosomes can be used as biomimetic tools for regenerative medicine. In this study we have explored the use of cell-generated exosomes as tools to induce lineage specific differentiation of stem cells. Our results indicate that proosteogenic exosomes isolated from cell cultures can induce lineage specific differentiation of naive MSCs in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, exosomes can also bind to matrix proteins such as type I collagen and fibronectin enabling them to be tethered to biomaterials. Overall, the results from this study show the potential of cell derived exosomes in bone regenerative medicine and opens up new avenues for future research.","2016","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:35","3808674","","","2016","","Stem Cells Int.","Hijacking the Cellular Mail","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 11 Place: London Publisher: Hindawi Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000372969800001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\D9TUN3YD\Narayanan et al. - 2016 - Hijacking the Cellular Mail Exosome Mediated Diff.pdf","","","BONE; DELIVERY; ENDOCYTOSIS; MARROW STROMAL CELLS; MICRORNAS; OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; SCAFFOLD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies have revealed that exosomes released from adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) play important roles in ONFH therapy. The present study aimed to investigate whether exosomes derived from miR-378-overexpressing ASCs (miR-378-ASCs-Exos) could promote angiogenesis and osteogenesis in GC-induced ONFH. Methods In vitro, we investigated the osteogenic potential of miR-378-ASCs-Exos on bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) by alkaline phosphatase staining and western blotting. The angiogenic effects of miR-378-ASCs-Exos on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were examined by evaluating their proliferation, migration, and tube-forming analyses. We identified the underlying mechanisms of miR-378 in osteogenic and angiogenic regulation.

Results Administration of miR-378-ASCs-Exos improved the osteogenic and angiogenic potentials of BMSCs and HUVECs. miR-378 negatively regulated the suppressor of fused (Sufu) and activated Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, and recombinant Sufu protein reduced the effects triggered by miR-378-ASCs-Exos. In vivo experiments indicated that miR-378-ASCs-Exos markedly accelerated bone regeneration and angiogenesis, which inhibited the progression of ONFH.

Recent studies have shown that exosomes stimulate bone regeneration. Thus, it is worthwhile to explore whether exosomes could be a useful therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation.MethodsExosomes were isolated from hucMSCs. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed lncRNAs in myeloma-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Plasmids encoding LINC00520 or short hairpin RNA of LINC00520 were transfected into hucMSCs and then exosomes were isolated. After human osteoblasts hFOB1.19 were exposed to the obtained exosomes, cell survival, cell cycle, apoptosis and calcium deposits of hFOB1.19 cell were detected by MTT, 7-aminoactinomycin D, Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide and Alizarin red staining, respectively.ResultsIn hFOB1.19 cells, 10 x 10(9)/mL hucMSC-derived exosomes inhibited cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle, and promoted apoptosis, while hucMSCs or 1 x 10(9)/mL exosomes promoted cell proliferation, accelerated cell cycle, and promoted calcium deposits and the expression of OCN, RUNX2, collagen I and ALP. In hFOB1.19 cells, exosomes from hucMSCs with LINC00520 knockdown reduced the survival and calcium deposits, arrested the cell cycle, and enhanced the apoptosis, while exosomes from hucMSCs overexpressing LINC00520 enhance the proliferation and calcium deposits and accelerated the cell cycle.ConclusionsLINC00520 functions as a modulator of calcium deposits, and exosomes derived from hucMSCs overexpressing LINC00520 might be a novel therapeutic approach for osteoporosis.","2023-07-29","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:36","546","","1","18","","J.

However, current treatments for OA are limited to alleviating symptoms, with no therapies that prevent and regenerate cartilage deterioration. Purpose: To assess the effects of platelet-derived exosomes (Plt-exos) on OA and then to explore the potential molecular mechanism. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Exosomes derived from human apheresis platelets were isolated and identified. The effects of Plt-exos in protecting chondrocytes under interleukin 1 & beta; stimulation were evaluated by analyzing the proliferation and migration in human primary chondrocytes. RNA sequencing was later performed in vitro for primary chondrocytes to reveal the underlying mechanisms of Plt-exo treatment. Anterior cruciate ligament transection was used to construct an OA mice model, and intra-articular injection of Plt-exos was given once a week for 6 weeks. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after the last injection. Histologic and immunohistochemistry staining and micro-computed tomography analysis were performed to assess alterations of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Results: Plt-exos significantly promoted proliferation and migration of chondrocytes within a dose-dependent manner, as well as dramatically promoted cartilage regeneration and attenuated abnormal tibial subchondral bone remodeling, thus slowing the progression of OA. After being treated with Plt-exos, 1797 genes were differentially expressed in chondrocytes (923 upregulated and 874 downregulated genes). Functional enrichment results and hub genes were mainly involved in anti-inflammatory effects, mediating cell adhesion, stimulating cartilage repair, promoting anabolism, and inhibiting catabolism. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that Plt-exos promoted chondrocyte proliferation and migration in vitro, as well as attenuated cartilage degeneration, improved the microarchitecture of subchondral bone, and retarded OA progression in vivo.","2023-09","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:36","2975-2985","","11","51","","Am.

Exosomes reportedly have inducible and relatively stable components, allowing them to promote inflammatory bone repair, but obtaining i-PDLSCs exosomes with the ability to promote osteodifferentiation is challenging. In the present study, i-PDLSCs were extracted from periodontal membrane tissues of patients with severe periodontitis, and in vitro induction with gallic acid (GA) significantly promoted the proliferative activity of i-PDLSCs at a concentration of 10 mM, with TC0 of 11.057 mM and TC50 of 67.56 mM for i-PDLSCs. After mRNA sequencing, we found that GA could alleviate oxidative stress in i-PDLSCs and increase its mitochondrial membrane potential and glucose aerobic metabolism level, thus promoting the osteodifferentiation of i-PDLSCs. After exosomes of i-PDLSCs after GA induction (i-EXO-GA) were isolated by differential centrifugation, we found that 200 ug/mL of i-EXO-GA could remarkably promote the osteodifferentiation of i-PDLSCs. Overall, our results suggest that GA induction can enhance the proliferation and osteodifferentiation in primary cultures of i-PDLSCs in vitro, mediated by alleviating oxidative stress and glycometabolism levels in cells, which further influences the osteodifferentiation-promoting ability of i-EXO-GA. Overall, we provide a viable cell and exosome induction culture method for treating inflammatory alveolar defects associated with periodontitis.","2022-09","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:36","1392","","9","12","","Life-Basel","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 17 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:000856820100001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\VQ395BY5\Dai et al. - 2022 - Gallic Acid Ameliorates the Inflammatory State of .pdf","","","aerobic glucose metabolism; ANGIOGENESIS; BIOLOGY; DIFFERENTIATION; exosomes; gallic acid; osteodifferentiation; oxidative stress; periodontal membrane stem cells; periodontitis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These exosomes also contained wide size distribution of RNA, including RNA in the size of microRNAs. The exosomes were shown to interact with human mesenchymal stem cells. After 24 h of culture, a considerable portion of the MSCs had internalised PKH67-labelled exosomes. Furthermore, after 72 h, the gene expression of the osteogenic markers runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) had increased in comparison with control medium, whereas no significant difference in osteocalcin (OC) expression was demonstrated. The present results show that, under given experimental conditions, monocytes communicate with MSCs via exosomes, resulting in the uptake of exosomes in MSCs and the stimulation of osteogenic differentiation. The present observations suggest that exosomes constitute an additional mode of cell-cell signalling with an effect on MSC differentiation during the transition from injury and inflammation to bone regeneration.","2013-09-18","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:36","e75227","","9","8","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 7 Place: San Francisco Publisher: Public Library Science Web of Science ID: WOS:000324695900101","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\6IXXPQSL\Ekstrom et al. - 2013 - Monocyte Exosomes Stimulate the Osteogenic Gene Ex.pdf","","","ACCUMULATION; DIFFERENTIATION; GROWTH; IN-VITRO; MACROPHAGES; MECHANISM; PROTEIN; RNA; TUMOR-DERIVED EXOSOMES; VESICLES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With unique bone resorption capabilities, as large multinucleated cells, osteocytes participate in bone remodeling and they are produced by the mononuclear/macrophage cells under activation of Wnt and Runx2. The mechanism underlying osteogenesis remains unclear. We investigated the impact of exosomal miR-29a derived from BMSCs on bone development and formation. In this study, BMSCs were transfected and then injected into mice followed by analysis of femur and skull development and regeneration by HE staining and CT scanning, and the expression of DKK1, Runx-2, and osteogenic biomarkers (Osterix, Satb2, ALP, and BSP) by western blot and RT-qPCR.

Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold significant tissue regeneration promise. Silver nanoparticles (Ag) have been suggested as the surface modification technique for various medical devices. Materials and Methods: Ag and human bone marrow MSC (hBMSC)-derived exosomes (MSCs-exo) were used to modify the PCL scaffold. The impact of different scaffolds on immune cells and MSC proliferation and differentiation was further evaluated. Results: MSCs-exo exhibited cup-shaped morphology with a diameter around 100 nm. MSCs-exo were enriched with exosome marker CD81 and showed good internalization into recipient cells. 200 ng/ml Ag nanoparticles and MSCs-exo were further used to modify the PCL scaffold. The internalization study further indicated a similar releasing pattern of exosomes from Ag/MSCs-exo hybrid scaffolds into RAW264.7 and hBMSCs at 12 and 24 h, respectively. Macrophages play an important role during different stages of bone regeneration. The MTT and confocal microscopy study demonstrated no significant toxicity of exosome and/or Ag hybrid scaffolds for macrophages and MSCs. Inflammatory macrophages were further used to mimic the inflammatory environment. A mixed population of elongated and round morphology was noted in the exosome and Ag hybrid group, in which the proinflammatory genes and secretion of IL-6 and TNF-alpha were significantly reduced. In addition, the exosome and Ag hybrid scaffolds could significantly boost the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Discussion: This study highlights the possibility of using Ag nanoparticles and MSCs-exo to modify the PCL scaffold, thus providing new insight into the development of the novel immunomodulatory biomembrane.","2021-08-02","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:36","699802","","","9","","Front.

Studies have shown that OCLs exhibit various phenotypes and functions due to variations in the source(s) of precursor cells, cytokine expressions, and microenvironment-dependent factors. During these conditions, inflammatory osteoclasts (iOCLs) lose their immune-suppressive effect relative to OCLs under physiological conditions. This induces TNF alpha-producing CD4(+) T cells in an antigen-dependent manner and finally leads to cascade amplification of iOCLs. OCL-derived exosomes have been reported to regulate OCL formation and inhibit the osteoblast activity. However, the specific function and mechanism of iOCL-derived exosomes on osteoblast have not been studied yet. In the present study, we compare the osteoblast promoting activities of iOCL-derived exosomes and OCL-derived exosomes. We found that iOCLs exosomes specifically target osteoblasts through ephrinA2/EphA2. Mechanistically, the lncRNA LIOCE is enriched in iOCL exosomes and promotes the osteoblast activity after being incorporated into osteoblasts. Furthermore, our results revealed that exosomal lncRNA LIOCE stabilizes osteogenic transcription factor Osterix by interacting and reducing the ubiquitination level of Osterix. This study demonstrated that the bone loss is alleviated in the inflammatory osteolysis mice model after injection of iOCL exosomes encapsulating lncRNA LIOCE. The role of exosomes encapsulating lncRNA LIOCE in promoting bone formation was well established in the rat bone repair model. Our results indicate that iOCL-derived exosomal lncRNA LIOCE promotes bone formation by upregulating Osx expression, and thus, the exosomes encapsulating lncRNA LIOCE may be an effective strategy to increase bone formation in osteoporosis and other bone metabolic disorders.","2022-02","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:36","e22115","","2","36","","Faseb J.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 17 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000747987800014","","","","","BIOLOGY; CELLS; exosomes; inflammatory osteoclasts; lncRNA; osteoblasts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, the interactions between macrophages and PDLSCs in OTM remain to be investigated. Consequently, the present study was proposed to explore the effect of different polarization states of macrophages on the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. Methods: After M0, M1 and M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (M0-exo, M1-exo and M2-exo) treatment of primary cultured human PDLSCs, respectively, mineralized nodules were observed by Alizarin red S staining, and the expression of ALP and OCN mRNA and protein were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, correspondingly. Identification of differentially expressed microRNAs (DE-miRNA) in M0-exo and M2-exo by miRNA microarray, and GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of DE-miRNA targets, and construction of protein-protein interaction networks. Results: M2-exo augmented mineralized nodule formation and upregulated ALP and OCN expression in PDLSCs, while M0-exo had no significant effect. Compared to M0-exo, a total of 52 DE-miRNAs were identified in M2-exo. The expression of hsa-miR-6507-3p, hsa-miR-4731-3p, hsa-miR-4728-3p, hsa-miR-3614-5p and hsa-miR-6785-3p was significantly down-regulated, and the expression of hsa-miR-6085, hsa-miR-4800-5p, hsa-miR-4778-5p, hsa-miR-6780b-5p and hsa-miR-1227-5p was significantly up-regulated in M2-exo compared to M0-exo. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the downstream targets of DE-miRNAs were mainly involved in the differentiation and migration of multiple cells. Conclusions: In summary, we have indicated for the first time that M2-exo can promote osteogenic differentiation of human PDLSCs, and have revealed the functions and pathways involved in the DE-miRNAs of M0-exo and M2-exo and their downstream targets.","2022-12-27","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:36","647","","1","22","","BMC Oral Health","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 14 Place: London Publisher: BMC Web of Science ID: WOS:000905048700001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\M7THMJM3\Liao et al. - 2022 - Comprehensive analysis of M2 macrophage-derived ex.pdf","","","Exosome; Macrophage polarization; microRNA; Orthodontic tooth movement; Periodontal ligament stem cells; STORAGE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are important in bone-related diseases. Exosomes, as mediators of cell communication, have potential in cell processes. Previous studies have focused on muscle factors' regulation of bone remodeling, but research on exosomes is lacking.Methods: In order to confirm the therapeutic effect of mechanically stimulated myocytes (C2C12) derived exosomes (Exosome-MS) on the Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis(GIOP) compared with unmechanically stimulated myocytes (C2C12) derived exosomes (Exosomes), we established a dexamethasone-induced osteoporosis model in vivo and in vitro. Cell viability and proliferation were assessed using CCK8 and EDU assays. Osteogenic potential was evaluated through Western blotting, real-time PCR, alkaline phosphatase activity assay, and alizarin red staining. Differential expression of miRNAs was determined by high-throughput sequen-cing. The regulatory mechanism of miR-92a-3p on cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation via the PTEN/AKT pathway was investigated using real-time PCR, luciferase reporter gene assay, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. The therapeutic effects of exosomes were evaluated in vivo using microCT, HE staining, Masson staining, and immunohistochemistry.Results: In this study, we found that exosomes derived from mechanical stress had a positive impact on the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Importantly, we demonstrated that miR-92a-3p mimics could reverse dexamethasone-induced osteoporosis in vitro and in vivo, indicating that mechanical stress-induced mouse myoblast-derived exosomes could promote osteogenesis and prevent the occurrence and progression of osteoporosis in mice through miR-92a-3p/PTEN/ AKT signaling pathway.Conclusion: Exosomes derived from mechanical stress-induced myoblasts can promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentia-tion of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells through miR-92a-3p/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, and can have a therapeutic effect on glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in mice in vivo.","2023","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:37","7583-7603","","","18","","Int.

Exosomes are a type of microvesicles (MVs) that may play a role in tissue-tissue and cell-cell communication in homeostasis and diseases. We hypothesized that exosomes function in a novel regulatory network that contributes to OA pathogenesis and examined the function of exosomes in communication among joint tissue cells. Methods: Human synovial fibroblasts (SFB) and articular chondrocytes were obtained from normal knee joints. Exosomes isolated from conditioned medium of SFB were analyzed for size, numbers, markers and function. Normal articular chondrocytes were treated with exosomes from SFB, and Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) stimulated SFB. OA-related genes expression was quantified using real-time PCR. To analyze exosome effects on cartilage tissue, we performed glycosaminoglycan release assay. Angiogenic activity of these exosomes was tested in migration and tube formation assays. Cytokines and miRNAs in exosomes were analyzed by Bio-Plex multiplex assay and NanoString analysis. Results: Exosomes from IL-1 beta stimulated SFB significantly up-regulated MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 expression in articular chondrocytes, and down-regulated COL2A1 and ACAN compared with SFB derived exosomes. Migration and tube formation activity were significantly higher in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with the exosomes from IL-1 beta stimulated SFB, which also induced significantly more proteoglycan release from cartilage explants. Inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, MMP-3 and VEGF in exosomes were only detectable at low level. IL-1 beta, TNF alpha MMP-9 and MMP-13 were not detectable in exosomes. NanoString analysis showed that levels of 50 miRNAs were differentially expressed in exosomes from IL-1 beta stimulated SFB compared to non-stimulated SFB. Conclusions: Exosomes from IL-1 beta stimulated SFB induce OA-like changes both in vitro and in ex vivo models. Exosomes represent a novel mechanism by which pathogenic signals are communicated among different cell types in OA-affected joints.","2014","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:37","R163","","4","16","","Arthritis Res.

Hypoxia and miR-210 play an important role in hematological malignancies. In an attempt to elucidate the specificity of the pathways of hypoxia and miR-210 in suppression of osteoblastic differentiation in MM patients, we examined the effect of miR-210 and hypoxia on expression of important cytokines and genes of myeloma cells. Differentiation of BM-MSCs towards osteoblastic cells in response to microvesicles (MVs) was also investigated. Finally, we proposed a molecular model on how HIF-1 alpha may promote bone lesions in MM patients. To validate the effect of miR-210 and HIF-1 alpha on targeted genes, the shRNA of HIF-1 alpha and off-hsa-miR-210 were transfected into RPMI-8226 cells. BM-MSCs were cultured in osteoblastic inducer and 50 mu g/mL of MVs derived from both hypoxic and normoxic myeloma cells. We designed an in vitro study to establish the effects of HIF-1 alpha and miR-210 on the crosstalk between MM and osteoblasts. We here showed that hypoxia-induced miR-210 increased the mRNA expression of VLA-4, CXCR4, IL-6 and TGF-beta in myeloma cells. MiR-210 is mandatory for the hypoxia-increased resistance of MM cells to melphalan. Moreover, MVs derived from hypoxic myeloma cells substantially decreased osteoblast differentiation. Considered comprehensively, our findings explain one of the reasons of bone loss that occurs at the sites of MM and a nascent crosstalk model in MM pathogenesis.","2018","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:37","647-662","","","17","","EXCLI J.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 16 Place: Dortmund Publisher: Excli Journal Managing Office Web of Science ID: WOS:000437535900005","","","","","BONE DESTRUCTION; CELL-DERIVED EXOSOMES; DISEASE; GROWTH; hypoxia; HYPOXIC NICHE; INHIBITION; INTERLEUKIN-6; microvesicle; MICROVESICLES; miR-210; MOUSE MODELS; multiple myeloma; osteoblast; STEM-CELLS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research has shown that exosomes derived from bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can modulate inflammation during tissue healing. Thus, our study aimed to enhance tendon-bone healing by use of BMSC-derived exosomes (BMSC-Exos). Material/Methods: The mouse tendon-bone reconstruction model was established, and the mice were randomly divided into 3 groups: the control group, the hydrogel group, and the hydrogel+exosome group, with 30 mice in each group. At 7 days, 14 days, and 1 month after surgery, tendon-bone junction samples were harvested, and the macrophage polarization and tendon-bone healing were evaluated based on histology, immunofluorescence, and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Results: In the early phase, we observed significantly higher numbers of M2 macrophages and more anti-inflammatory and chondrogenic-related factors in the hydrogel+BMSC-Exos group compared with the control group and the hydrogel group. The Ml macrophages and related proinflammatory factors decreased. Cell apoptosis decreased in the hydrogel+BMSC-Exos group, while cell proliferation increased; in particular, the CD146+ stem cells substantially increased. At 1 month after surgery, there was more fibrocartilage in the hydrogel+BMSC-Exos group than in the other groups. Biomechanical testing showed that the maximum force, strength, and elastic modulus were significantly improved in the hydrogel+BMSC-Exos group. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence that the local administration of BMSC-Exos promotes the formation of fibrocarti- lage by increasing M2 macrophage polarization in tendon-to-bone healing, leading to improved biomechanical properties. These findings provide a basis for the potential clinical use of BMSC-Exos in tendon-bone repair.","2020-05-05","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:37","e923328","","","26","","Med.

Prostate and breast cancer patients frequently exhibit osteoblastic-type and osteolytic-type bone metastasis, respectively. In metastatic lesions, tumor cells interact with many different cell types, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and mesenchymal stem cells, resulting in an osteoblastic or osteolytic phenotype. However, the mechanisms responsible for the modification of bone remodeling have not been fully elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are transferred between cells via exosomes and serve as intercellular communication tools, and numerous studies have demonstrated that cancer-secreted miRNAs are capable of modifying the tumor microenvironment. Thus, cancer-secreted miRNAs can induce an osteoblastic or osteolytic phenotype in the bone metastatic microenvironment. In this study, we performed a comprehensive expression analysis of exosomal miRNAs secreted by several human cancer cell lines and identified eight types of human miRNAs that were highly expressed in exosomes from osteoblastic phenotype-inducing prostate cancer cell lines. One of these miRNAs, hsa-miR-940, significantly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro by targeting ARHGAP1 and FAM134A. Interestingly, although MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells are commonly known as an osteolytic phenotype-inducing cancer cell line, the implantation of miR-940-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells induced extensive osteoblastic lesions in the resulting tumors by facilitating the osteogenic differentiation of host mesenchymal cells. Our results suggest that the phenotypes of bone metastases can be induced by miRNAs secreted by cancer cells in the bone microenvironment.","2018-02-27","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:37","2204-2209","","9","115","","Proc.

Methods: Critical-size osteochondral defects (4.5-mm diameter and 1.5-mm depth) were created on the trochlear grooves in the knees of 18 rabbits and were randomly allocated to 2 treatment groups: (1) exosomes and HA combination and (2) HA alone. Three 1-mL injections of either exosomes and HA or HA alone were administered intra-articularly immediately after surgery and thereafter at 7 and 14 days after surgery. At 6 and 12 weeks, gross evaluation, histologic and immunohistochemical analysis, and scoring were performed. The functional biomechanical competence of the repaired cartilage also was evaluated. Results: Compared with defects treated with HA, defects treated with exosomes and HA showed significant improve-ments in macroscopic scores (P = .032; P = .001) and histologic scores (P = .005; P < .001) at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. Defects treated with exosomes and HA also demonstrated improvements in mechanical properties compared with HA -treated defects, with significantly greater Young's moduli (P < .05) and stiffness (P < .05) at 6 and 12 weeks. By 12 weeks, the newly-repaired tissues in defects treated with exosomes and HA composed mainly of hyaline cartilage that are mechanically and structurally superior to that of HA-treated defects and demonstrated mechanical properties that approximated that of adjacent native cartilage (P > .05). In contrast, HA-treated defects showed some repair at 6 weeks, but this was not sustained, as evidenced by significant deterioration of histologic scores (P = .002) and a plateau in mechanical properties from 6 to 12 weeks. Conclusions: This study shows that the combination of MSC exosomes and HA administered at a clinically acceptable frequency of 3 intra-articular injections can promote sustained and functional cartilage repair in a rabbit post-traumatic cartilage defect model, when compared with HA alone.","2020-08","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:38","2215-+","","8","36","","Arthroscopy","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 16 Place: Philadelphia Publisher: W B Saunders Co-Elsevier Inc Web of Science ID: WOS:000554825900029","","","","","ARTICULAR-CARTILAGE; DEFECTS; EXPRESSION; JOINT; KNEE; OSTEOARTHRITIS; REGENERATION; SOFT BIOLOGICAL TISSUES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patient with diabetes have increased risks of bone fracture. Previous studies report that diabetes could affect bone metabolism, however, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. MethodsWe isolated exosomes secreted by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells of normal and diabetic mice and test their effects on osteogenesis and adipogenesis. Then we screened the differential microRNAs by high-throughput sequencing and explored the function of key microRNA in vitro and in vivo. ResultsWe find that lower bone mass and higher marrow fat accumulation, also called bone-fat imbalance, exists in diabetic mouse model. Exosomes secreted by normal bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs-Exos) enhanced osteogenesis and suppressed adipogenesis, while these effects were diminished in diabetic BMSCs-Exos. miR-221, as one of the highly expressed miRNAs within diabetic BMSCs-Exos, showed abilities of suppressing osteogenesis and promoting adipogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Elevation of miR-221 level in normal BMSCs-Exos impairs the ability of regulating osteogenesis and adipogenesis. Intriguingly, using the aptamer delivery system, delivery normal BMSCs-Exos specifically to BMSCs increased bone mass, reduced marrow fat accumulation, and promoted bone regeneration in diabetic mice. ConclusionWe demonstrate that BMSCs derived exosomal miR-221 is a key regulator of diabetic osteoporosis, which may represent a potential therapeutic target for diabetes-related skeletal disorders.","2023-04-14","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:38","1149168","","","14","","Front.

The mechanisms underlying this disorder have not been deeply investigated. Due to its rarity, no guidelines are currently available for treatment and management of GSD. We recently evaluated the cellular alterations of the bone remodeling in patients showing that osteoclast precursors displayed increased ability to differentiate into osteoclasts and that affected osteoclasts resorb bone more actively than control cells. Moreover, osteoblasts isolated from a patient showed a defective ability to form mineralized nodules. In this paper, we investigated the molecular pathways involved in the cellular defects of GSD bone cells. For this study, we recruited nine patients and performed miRNome analysis of bone cells. Between the 178 miRNAs robustly expressed in GSD osteoclasts, significant modulation of three miRNAs (miR-1246, miR-1-3p, and miR-137-3p) involved in the regulation of osteoclast formation and activity or in the angiomatous proliferation was found in patients' cells. Interestingly, miR-1246 was also up-regulated in serum exosomes from patients. Analysis of miRNAs from patient osteoblasts suggested alteration of miR-204a-5p, miR-615-3p and miR-378a-3p regulating osteoblast function and differentiation. The resulting miRNA pattern may help to understand better the mechanisms involved in GSD and to identify new potential therapeutic targets for this rare disease.","2021-03","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:38","e21424","","3","35","","Faseb J.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 17 Place: Hoboken Publisher: Wiley Web of Science ID: WOS:000629576700013","","","","","DISAPPEARING BONE; Gorham&#8208; LYMPHANGIOGENESIS; MASSIVE OSTEOLYSIS; MECHANISM; MICRORNAS; miRNA; osteoblast; osteoclast; OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; REGULATORS; SERUM; Stout disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pathogenesis of GIONFH is still controversial, and abnormal bone metabolism caused by glucocorticoids may be one of the important factors. Exosomes, owing to their positive effect on bone repair, show promising therapeutic effects on bone-related diseases. In this study, we hypothesised that exosomes reduce osteocyte apoptosis in rat GIONFH via the miR-21-PTEN-AKT signalling pathway. Methods: To evaluate the effects of exosomes in GIONFH, a dexamethasone-treated or exosome-treated in vitro cell model and a methylprednisolone-treated in vivo rat model were set up. In vitro, a CCK-8 assay and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine staining were performed to evaluate the proliferation of osteocytes. Further, a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay, annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate-propidium iodide staining, and western blotting were conducted to evaluate the apoptosis of osteocytes. In vivo, we used micro-computed tomography and histological and immunohistochemical analyses to assess the effects of exosomes. Moreover, the mechanism of exosome action on osteocyte apoptosis through the miR-21-PTEN-AKT pathway was investigated by high-throughput RNA sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridisation, luciferase reporter assays, and western blotting. Results: High-throughput RNA sequencing results showed that the AKT signalling pathway was up-regulated in the exosome group. Quantitative PCR and western blotting confirmed that the relative expression of genes in the AKT pathway was up-regulated. Western blotting revealed that AKT activated by exosomes inhibited osteocyte apoptosis. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridisation and luciferase reporter assays were performed to confirm the interaction between miR-21 and PTEN. According to the experiment in vivo, exosomes prevented GIONFH in a rat model as evidenced by micro-computed tomography scanning and histological and immunohistochemical analyses. Conclusions: Exosomes are effective at inhibiting osteocyte apoptosis (in MLO-Y4 cells) and at preventing rat GIONFH. These beneficial effects are mediated by the miR-21-PTEN-AKT signalling pathway.","2019","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:38","1861-1871","","9","15","","Int. J. Biol.

However, the exact mechanism of osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs remains unknown, especially the role of exosomes played in. The DPSCs were cultured and received osteogenic induction; then, exosomes from osteogenic-induced DPSCs (OI-DPSC-Ex) at different time intervals were isolated and sequenced for circular RNA (circRNA) expression profiles. Gradually, increased circular lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (circLPAR1) expression was found in the OI-DPSC-Ex coincidentally with the degree of osteogenic differentiation. Meanwhile, results from osteogenic differentiation examinations showed that the OI-DPSC-Ex had osteogenic effect on the recipient homotypic DPSCs. To investigate the mechanism of exosomal circLPAR1 on osteogenic differentiation, we verified that circLPAR1 could competently bind to hsa-miR-31, by eliminating the inhibitory effect of hsa-miR-31 on osteogenesis, therefore promoting osteogenic differentiation of the recipient homotypic DPSCs. Our study showed that exosomal circRNA played an important role in osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs and provided a novel way of utilization of exosomes for the treatment of bone deficiencies.","2020-09-28","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:38","6319395","","","2020","","Biomed Res.

This study aimed to clarify the function and mechanism of exosomes containing polylactic acid (PLA), polylactic acid copolymer and BMP-2 in tendon bone healing of rotator cuff tear. First, CD44 expression in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and CD90 and CD44 in exosomes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Then, stability and targeting identification of exosome-delivered bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and PLA microcapsules were measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), DiO/DiI staining. Finally, tendon-bone repair after acute rotator cuff rupture in rabbits was established, and the function of BMP-2 exosomes for tendon bone healing in rotator cuff tear was evaluated by micro-CT, biomechanical determination and histochemical staining methods. The results showed that the exosomes of polyaspartic acid-polylactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer (PASP-PLGA) microcapsules were successfully established which showed good stability and targeting. The bone mineral density (BMD), tissue mineral density (TMD) and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) were higher, while the stiffness and the ultimate load strength of the tendon interface were enhanced under treatment with exosomes of PASP-PLGA microcapsules. Histochemical staining showed that exosomes of PASP-PLGA microcapsules promoted tendon and bone interface healing after rotator cuff injury. The tendon regeneration- and cartilage differentiation-related protein expressions were significantly upregulated under treatment with exosomes of PASP-PLGA microcapsules. In conclusion, exosome-delivered BMP-2 and PLA promoted tendon bone healing in rotator cuff tear via Smad/RUNX2 pathway.

Artificial GAGs like sulfated hyaluronan (sHA) exhibit pro-osteogenic properties and boost healing processes. Hence, they are of high interest for supporting bone regeneration and wound healing. Although sulfated GAGs (sGAGs) appear intracellularly, the knowledge about intracellular effects and putative interaction partners is scarce. Here we used an affinity-purification mass spectrometry-based (AP-MS) approach to identify novel and particularly intracellular sGAG-interacting proteins in human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC). Overall, 477 proteins were found interacting with at least one of four distinct sGAGs. Enrichment analysis for protein localization showed that mainly intracellular and cell-associated interacting proteins were identified. The interaction of sGAGwith alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor-associated protein (LRPAP1), exportin-1 (XPO1), and serine protease HTRA1 (HTRA1) was confirmed in reverse assays. Consecutive pathway and cluster analysis led to the identification of biological processes, namely processes involving binding and processing of nucleic acids, LRP1-dependent endocytosis, and exosome formation. Respecting the preferentially intracellular localization of sGAG in vesicle-like structures, also the interaction data indicate sGAG-specific modulation of vesicle-based transport processes. By identifying many sGAG-specific interacting proteins, our data provide a resource for upcoming studies aimed at molecular mechanisms and understanding of sGAG cellular effects.","2021-10","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:38","1427-1440","","11","402","","Biol.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of BMSC-Exos and internal microRNA-210-3p (miRNA-210) on GCS-ONFH in an in vitro hydrocortisone-induced BMECs injury model and an in vivo rat GCS-ONFH model.MethodsBMECs, BMSCs and BMSC-Exos were isolated and validated. BMECs after the treatment of hydrocortisone were cocultured with different concentrations of BMSC-Exos, then proliferation, migration, apoptosis and angiogenesis of BMECs were evaluated by CCK-8, Annexin V-FITC/PI, cell scratch and tube formation assays. BMSCs were transfected with miRNA-210 mimics and miRNA-210 inhibitors, then BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 mimic and BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 inhibitor secreted from such cells were collected. The differences between BMSC-Exos, BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 mimic and BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 inhibitor in protecting BMECs against GCS treatment were analyzed by methods mentioned above. Intramuscular injections of methylprednisolone were performed on Sprague-Dawley rats to establish an animal model of GCS-ONFH, then tail intravenous injections of BMSC-Exos, BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 mimic or BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 inhibitor were conducted after methylprednisolone injection. Histological and immunofluorescence staining and micro-CT were performed to evaluate the effects of BMSC-Exos and internal miRNA-210 on the in vivo GCS-ONFH model.ResultsDifferent concentrations of BMSC-Exos, especially high concentration of BMSC-Exos, could enhance the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis ability and reduce the apoptosis rates of BMECs treated with GCS. Compared with BMSC-Exos, BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 mimic could further enhance the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis ability and reduce the apoptosis rates of BMECs, while BMECs in the GCS + BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 inhibitor group showed reduced proliferation, migration and angiogenesis ability and higher apoptosis rates. In the rat GCS-ONFH model, BMSC-Exos, especially BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 mimic, could increase microvascular density and enhance bone remodeling of femoral heads.ConclusionsBMSC-Exos containing miRNA-210 could serve as potential therapeutics for protecting BMECs and ameliorating the progression of GCS-ONFH.","2023-12-07","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:38","939","","1","18","","J.

Here, we used acellular cartilage extracellular matrix (ACECM) to prepare 3D scaffolds and 2D substrates by low-temperature deposition modeling (LDM) and tape casting. We aimed to investigate whether MSC-Exos cultured on scaffolds of different dimensions could improve the poor joint cavity microenvironment caused by cartilage injury and to explore the related mechanisms. In vitro experiments showed that exosomes derived from MSCs cultured on three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds (3D-Exos) had increased efficiency. In short-term animal experiments, compared with exosomes derived from MSCs cultured in a twodimensional (2D) environment (2D-Exos), 3D-Exos had a stronger ability to regulate the joint cavity microenvironment. Long-term animal studies confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of 3D-Exos over 2D-Exos. Thus, 3D-Exos were applied in the rat knee osteochondral defect model after adsorption in the micropores of the scaffold and combined with subsequent articular cavity injections, and they showed a stronger cartilage repair ability. These findings provide a new strategy for repairing articular cartilage damage. Furthermore, miRNA sequencing indicated that the function of 3D-Exos may be associated with high expression of miRNAs. Thus, our study provides valuable insights for the design of 3D-Exos to promote cartilage regeneration.","2023-04","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:38","100549","","","19","","Mater.

Cell-free therapy based on stem cell exosomes is a safer and more promising approach for tissue regeneration. Here, we investigated the effect of exosomes from human urine-derived stem cells (USCs) and their subpopulations (CD133+USCs) on RC healing.Methods: USCs were isolated from urine and sorted by flow cytometry to obtain CD133+ urine-derived stem cells (CD133+ USCs). Urine-derived stem cell exosomes (USC-Exos) and CD133+ urine-derived stem cell exosomes (CD133+ USC-Exos) were subsequently isolated from the cell supernatant and identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), particle size analysis, and Western blot. We performed in vitro functional assays to evaluate the effects of USC-Exos and CD133+ USC-Exos on human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) pro-liferation, migration, osteogenic differentiation, and chondrogenic differentiation. In vivo experiments were performed by local injection of exosome-hydrogel complexes for the treatment of RC injury. The effects of CD133+ USC-Exos and USC-Exos on RC healing were assessed from imaging, histological, and biomechanical tests.Results: CD133+ USCs were positive for CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD133, but negative for CD34 and CD45. Differentiation ability test results showed that both USCs and CD133+ USCs had the potential for osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation, but CD133+ USCs had stronger chondrogenic differentiation ability. CD133+ USC-Exos and USC-Exos could be efficiently taken up by BMSCs and promote their migration, osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. However, CD133+ USC-Exos could promote the chondrogenic dif-ferentiation of BMSCs more than USC-Exos. Compared with USC-Exos, CD133+ USC-Exos could promote the healing of bone-tendon interface (BTI) more effectively, which might be related to its ability to promote the differentiation of BMSCs into chondroblasts. Although the two exosomes exhibited the same effect in promoting subchondral bone repair in BTI, the CD133+ USC-Exos group had higher histological scores and stronger biomechanical properties.Conclusion: CD133+ USC-Exos hydrogel complex may become a promising therapeutic approach for RC healing based on stem cell exosomes.The translational potential of this article: This is the first study to assess the specific role of CD133+ USC-Exos in RC healing which may be related to the activation of BMSCs by CD133+ USC-Exos towards chondrogenic differen-tiation. Further, our study provides a reference for possible future treatment of BTI by applying CD133+ USC-Exos hydrogel complex.","2023-03","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:38","100-112","","","39","","J.

The interaction between muscle and skeleton exerts pivotal roles in bone remodeling. This study aimed to explore the function of myoblast-derived exosomal Prrx2 in osteogenic differentiation and its potential mechanisms.MethodsExosomes were isolated from myogenic differentiated C2C12 cells. qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to determine target molecule expression. Osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was evaluated by Alizarin red staining, ALP activity and levels of OCN, OPN, RUNX2, and BMP2. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, RIP, and ChIP assays were performed to verify the interaction between molecules. The nuclear translocation of YAP1 was observed by immunofluorescence staining. In vivo osteoporotic model was established by ovariectomy in mice. Bone loss was examined using HE staining.ResultsPrrx2 expression was elevated in myogenic differentiated C2C12 cells and their exosomes. Myoblast-derived exosomal Prrx2 enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Delivering exosomal Prrx2 directly bond to MIR22HG promoter and promoted its transcription and expression. MIR22HG enhanced expression and nuclear translocation of YAP via sponging miR-128, thus facilitating BMSC osteogenic differentiation. Knockdown of exosomal Prrx2 suppressed osteogenic differentiation, which could be abolished by MIR22HG overexpression. Similarly, miR-128 inhibitor or YAP overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of MIR22HG depletion or miR-128 mimics on osteogenic differentiation. Finally, myoblast-derived exosomal Prrx2 alleviated osteoporosis in mice via up-regulating MIR22HG and activating the Hippo pathway.ConclusionMyoblast-derived exosomal Prrx2 contributes to transcriptional activation of MIR22HG to activate YAP pathway via sponging miR-128, thereby facilitating osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.","2023-04-20","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:38","54","","1","29","","Mol.

Design: Synovial fluid samples were obtained from three patients, and SFDCs were isolated and expanded either in a 2D monolayer culture or seeded within a transglutaminase cross-linked gelatin (Col-Tgel) to create a 3D gel culture. Exosomes derived from each environment were isolated and characterized. Then, their effects on cartilage-cell proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation were assessed using an in vitro organoid model, and their potential for enhancing cartilage repair was evaluated using a rat cartilage defect model. Results: SFDCs obtained from different donors reached a state of senescence after four passages in 2D culture. However, transferring these cells to a 3D culture environment mitigated the senescence and improved cell viability. The 3D-cultured exosomes exhibited enhanced potency in promoting chondrogenic differentiation, as evidenced by the increased expression of chondrogenic genes and greater deposition of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix. Furthermore, the 3D-cultured exosomes demonstrated superior effectiveness in enhancing cartilage repair and exhibited better healing properties compared to exosomes derived from a 2D culture. Conclusions: The optimized 3D culture provided a more favorable environment for the proliferation of human synovial cells and the secretion of exosomes compared to the 2D culture. The 3D-cultured exosomes exhibited greater potential for promoting chondrogenic gene expression in vitro and demonstrated improved healing properties in repairing cartilage defects compared to exosomes derived from the 2D culture.","2023-12","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:38","3145","","12","11","","Biomedicines","Enhancement of Chondrogenic Markers by Exosomes Derived from Cultured Human Synovial Fluid-Derived Cells","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 15 Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI Web of Science ID: WOS:001130949500001","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\HKH39AFP\Han et al. - 2023 - Enhancement of Chondrogenic Markers by Exosomes De.pdf","","","3D encapsulation; ARTICULAR CHONDROCYTES; BONE-MARROW; cartilage repair; CARTILAGE TISSUE; chondrogenesis; exosome; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; OSTEOARTHRITIS; REGENERATION; SCAFFOLDS; synovial fluid-derived cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The development of surface modification techniques have brought a major paradigm shift for clinical bone tissue regeneration applications. In this study, we modified the surface of calcium silicate scaffolds (CS) with lithium ions (Li) via a simple immersion technique and evaluated its capabilities for bone regeneration. Li has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, osteogenic and chondrogenic capabilities via the promotion of several intracellular signalling pathways. Our results showed that Li ions could be easily coated onto the surfaces of CS scaffolds without affecting the microstructural properties o f CS itself. In addition, the modifications did not affect printing capabilities of CS and porous scaffolds could be fabricated via the extrusion method. Furthermore, the presence of Li showed improvements in surface roughness and hydrophilicity, thus leading to enhanced secretion of osteochondral-related regeneration factors such as ALP, BSP and Col II proteins. Subsequent in vivo studies, including histological and micro-CT analysis confirmed that our Li-modified CS scaffolds were able to promote osteochondral regeneration. From our NGS analysis, the enhanced osteo-chondrogenic capabilities of our scaffolds were hypothesised to be influenced by paracrine exosomes. Taken together, we hoped that our study could inspire more osteochondral regeneration studies using the surface modification techniques.","2022","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","139-141","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Soc","Los Alamitos","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","ISSN: 2471-7819 Num Pages: 3 Series Title: IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering Web of Science ID: WOS:000920384000030","","","","","3D-printed; calcium silicate; lithium; osteochondral defect; scaffold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE 22nd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that S1P and C1P can influence mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), each in a different manner. S1P stimulation promoted the formation of cellular aggregates of BMSCs and ASCs, while C1P had an effect on the regular growth pattern and expanded intercellular connections, thereby increasing the proliferative activity. Although osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was enhanced by the addition of S1P, the effectiveness of osteoblast differentiation was more evident in BMSCs, particularly when biochemical and molecular marker levels were considered. The results of the functional osteogenic differentiation assay, which includes an evaluation of the efficiency of extracellular matrix mineralization (SEM-EDX), revealed the formation of numerous mineral aggregates in BMSC cultures stimulated with S1P.

However, the DO process is slow, and the consolidation phase is long. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to explore the mechanism of DO, and shorten its duration. Recent studies reported that stem cell exosomes may play an important role in promoting angiogenesis related to DO, but the mechanism remains unclear. Methods: Canine endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) were isolated and cultured, and the expression of THBS1 in canine ECFCs were inhibited using a lentiviral vector. The exosomes secreted by canine ECFCs were isolated and extracted, and the effect of exosomes on the angiogenic activity of Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was detected by proliferation, migration, and tube formation experiments. WB and qRT-PCR were used to explore the effects and mechanisms of THBS1-mediated ECFC-Exos on HUVECs angiogenesis. Then, a mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) model was established in adult male beagles, and exosomes were injected into the canine peripheral blood. Micro-CT, H&E, Masson, and IHC staining were used to explore the effects and mechanisms of THBS1-mediated ECFC-Exos on angiogenesis and osteogenesis in the DO area. Results: ECFC-Exo accelerated HUVECs proliferation, migration and tube formation, and this ability was enhanced by inhibiting the expression of THBS1 in ECFC-Exo. Using Western blot-mediated detection, we demonstrated that inhibiting THBS1 expression in ECFCs-Exo activated PI3K, AKT, and ERK phosphorylation levels in HUVECs, which promoted VEGF and bFGF expressions. In the DO model of the canine mandible, ECFCs-Exo injected into the peripheral blood aggregated into the DO gap, thus promoting angiogenesis and bone formation in the DO tissue by reducing THBS1 expression in ECFC-Exo. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that ECFC-Exos markedly enhances angiogenesis of endothelial cells, and promotes bone healing in canine MDO. Thus, THBS1 plays a crucial role in the ECFC-Exos-mediated regulation of canine MDO angiogenesis and bone remodeling. The translational potential of this article: This study reveals that the angiogenic promotion via THBS1 suppression in ECFC-Exos may be a promising strategy for shortening the DO duration.","2022-11","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","12-22","","","37","","J.

The role of extra-cellular membrane vesicles (EMVs) as mediators of intercellular communication in modulating osteosarcoma-BME is unknown, and needs to be investigated. It is our hypothesis that osteosarcoma-EMVs contain pro-osteoclastogenic cargo which increases osteoclastic activity, and dysregulated bone remodeling in the osteosarcoma-BME. In this study, EMVs were isolated from the conditioned media of 143B and HOS human osteosarcoma cell cultures using differential ultracentrifugation. Nano-particle tracking analysis determined EMVs in the size range of 50-200 nm in diameter. The EMV yield from 143B cells was relatively higher compared to HOS cells. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the ultrastructure of 143B-EMVs and detected multivesicular bodies. Biochemical characterization of 143B-EMVs detected the expression of bioactive pro-osteoclastic cargo including matrix metalloproteinases-1 and -13 (MMP-1, -13), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), CD-9, and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-beta ligand (RANKL). Detection of a protein signature that is uniquely pro-osteoclastic in 143B-EMVs is a novel finding, and is significant as EMVs represent an interesting mechanism for potentially mediating bone destruction in the osteosarcoma-BME. This study further demonstrates that 143B cells actively mobilize calciumin the presence of ionomycin, and forskolin, and induce cytoskeleton rearrangements leading to vesicular biogenesis. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that 143B osteosarcoma cells generate EMVs mainly by mechanisms involving increased intracellular calcium or cAMP levels, and contain pro-osteoclastic cargo.","2014-06","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","331-340","","3","7","","Transl.

EXO contains miRNA-211, which has a variety of biological effects. However, little is known about whether miR-211 from BMSC-EXO affects the surrounding cells. Therefore, we aim to study the role of miRNA-211 derived from BMSC-EXO in regulating osteoclasts differentiation. Macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and nuclear factor kappa B receptor activator (RANKL) were used to stimulate bone marrow macrophages (BMM) to obtain osteoclasts, which were treated with BMSC-EXO or LPS followed by analysis of osteoclast-related genes expression by PCR, ROS release by flow cytometry, actin ring formation by immunofluorescence, and osteoclast differentiation by anti-tartrate acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Finally, an in vivo experiment was conducted to verify BMSC-EXO's effect on osteoporosis. BMSC-EXO significantly inhibited RNAKL-induced osteoclast differentiation of BMMs. During osteoclasts formation, BMSC-EXO inhibited ROS production induced by RANKL and the subsequent activation of NF-KB signaling pathway induced by ROS. In addition, BMSC-EXO significantly down-regulated the osteoclast genes including nuclear factor, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), C-fos, tartrate-resistant acid IP: 182.75.148.10 On: Tue, 04 Jan 2022 11:53:03 phosphatase (TRAP) and osteoclast-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor (OSCAR) in activated Copyright: American Scientific Publishers T cells. BMSC-EXO inhibited ROS release by promoting miR-211 expression, thereby inhibiting the Delivered by Ingenta NF-KB signaling and ultimately participating in osteoclasts differentiation. In LPS-induced mouse osteoporosis models, BMSC-EXO inhibited LPS-induced bone loss and exerted a protective effect. In conclusion, microRNA-211 derived from BMSC-EXO can regulate osteoclasts differentiation, suggesting that it might be used as a potential approach for treating osteoporosis.","2022-03","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","2024-01-26 18:26:39","544-550","","3","12","","J.

Recently, circRNAs have been proved to be a large class of animal RNAs with regulatory potency. However, whether circRNAs can respond to mechanical force (MF) and impact on human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and the orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) process remain unknown. Here, we investigated the circRNAs expression patterns in PDLSCs induced by MF and found that circRNAs were responsive to the MF in PDLSCs. Through the valid reads' distribution analysis, we found that the majority of reads in both the control PDLSCs and the MF-induced PDLSCs were distributed in exons. Then we analyzed Gene Ontology terms of genes that overlap with or are neighbors of the stress-responsive circRNAs and found unique enrichment patterns in biological processes, molecular function, and cellular component of PDLSCs. Next, we predicted the possible functions of circRNAs through circRNAs-miRNAs networks. We found that one circRNA may regulate one or several miRNA/miRNAs and one miRNA may interact with one or multiple circRNA/circRNAs. Importantly, a number of circRNAs were predicted to directly or indirectly regulate miRNAs-mediated osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells. For instance, circRNA3140 was highly and widely associated with microRNA-21, which plays a critical role in MF-induced osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism that MF can induce the expression changes of circRNAs in PDLSCs, which may modulate the OTM process and the alveolar bone remodeling.","2019-07","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:02","10166-10177","","7","234","","J.

Recent studies have shown that tendon regeneration and repair rely on multiple specific transcription factors to maintain TSPCs charac-teristics and functions. Here, we demonstrate Yap, a Hippo pathway downstream effector, is associated with TSPCs phenotype and regenerative potentials through gene expression analysis of tendon develop-ment and repair process. Exosomes have been proven an efficient transport platform for drug delivery. In this study, purified exosomes derived from donor platelets are loaded with recombinant Yap1 pro-tein (PLT-Exo-Yap1) via electroporation to promote the stemness and differentiation potentials of TSPCs in vitro . Programmed TSPCs with Yap1 import maintain stemness and functions after long-term passage in vitro . The increased oxidative stress levels of TSPCs are related to the phenotype changes in duplica-tive senescent processes. The results show that treatment with PLT-Exo-Yap1 significantly protects TSPCs against oxidative stressor-induced stemness loss and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) through the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. In addition, we fabricate an Exos-Yap1-functioned GelMA hydrogel with a parallel-aligned substrate structure to enhance TSPCs adhesion, promote cell stemness and force regenerative cells toward the tendon lineage for in vitro and in vivo tendon regeneration. The application of Exos-Yap1 functioned implant assists new tendon-like tissue formation with good mechanical proper-ties and locomotor functions in a full-cut Achilles tendon defect model. Thus, PLT-Exo-Yap1-functionalized GelMA promotes the rejuvenation of TSPCs to facilitate functional tendon regeneration.Statement of significanceThis is the first study to explore that the hippo pathway downstream effector Yap is involved in tendon aging and repair processes, and is associated with the regenerative capabilities of TSPCs.In this syudy, Platelet-derived exosomes (PLT-Exos) act as an appropriate carrier platform for the de-livery of recombinant Yap1 into TSPCs to regulate Yap activity.Effective Yap1 delivery inhibit oxidative stress-induced senescence associated phenotype of TSPCs by blocking ROS-mediated NF-kappa b signaling pathway activation.","2023-04-15","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:02","80-99","","","161","","Acta Biomater.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 20 Place: Oxford Publisher: Elsevier Sci Ltd Web of Science ID: WOS:000969066000001","","","","","COACTIVATOR; DIFFERENTIATION; GROWTH; INJURY; LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA; MOUSE; PATHWAY; Platelet-derived exosome; Rejuvenation; REPAIR; SELF-RENEWAL; SENESCENCE; Tendon regeneration; TSPCs; Yap1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) are derived from human amnions, which are typically discarded as medical waste, but were recently found to include cells with trilineage differentiation potential in vitro. Previous study has focused on the osteogenic differentiation ability of hAECs as seed cells in bone regeneration; however, their paracrine effects on osteoblasts (OBs) are yet to be elucidated. In the present study, conditioned medium (CM) derived from hAECs was used to determine their paracrine effects on the human fetal OB cell line (hFOB1.19), and the potential bioactive factors involved in this process were investigated. The results suggested that hAEC-CM markedly promoted the proliferation, migration and osteogenic differentiation of hFOB1.19 cells. Expression of transforming growth factor (1) (TGF(1)) and microRNA 34a-5p (miR-34a-5p) were detected in hAECs. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that TGF(1) and miR-34a-5p stimulated the differentiation of hFOB1.19 cells, and that TGF(1) promoted cell migration. Moreover, the effects of hAEC-CM were downregulated following the depletion of either TGF(1) or miR-34a-5p. These results demonstrated that hAECs promote OB differentiation through the secretion of TGF(1) and miR-34a-5p, and that hAECs may be an optimal cell source in bone regenerative medicine.","2018-02","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:02","791-799","","2","41","","Int.

A promising approach involves the utilization of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) derived exosomes. The hypothesis of this study was that these exosomes, when loaded onto a gelatin sponge, a common hemostatic material, would enhance hemostasis and accelerate wound healing.AIMTo investigate the hemostatic and wound healing efficacy of gelatin sponges loaded with hUC-MSCs-derived exosomes.METHODSUltracentrifugation was used to extract exosomes from hUC-MSCs. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot techniques were used to validate the exosomes. In vitro experiments were performed using L929 cells to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the exosomes and their impact on cell growth and survival. New Zealand rabbits were used for skin irritation experiments to assess whether they caused adverse skin reactions. Hemolysis test was conducted using a 2% rabbit red blood cell suspension to detect whether they caused hemolysis. Moreover, in vivo experiments were carried out by implanting a gelatin sponge loaded with exosomes subcutaneously in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to perform biocompatibility tests. In addition, coagulation index test was conducted to evaluate their impact on blood coagulation. Meanwhile, SD rat liver defect hemostasis model and full-thickness skin defect model were used to study whether the gelatin sponge loaded with exosomes effectively stopped bleeding and promoted wound healing.RESULTSThe NTA, TEM, and western blot experimental results confirmed that exosomes were successfully isolated from hUC-MSCs. The gelatin sponge loaded with exosomes did not exhibit significant cell toxicity, skin irritation, or hemolysis, and they demonstrated good compatibility in SD rats. Additionally, the effectiveness of the gelatin sponge loaded with exosomes in hemostasis and wound healing was validated. The results of the coagulation index experiment indicated that the gelatin sponge loaded with exosomes had significantly better coagulation effect compared to the regular gelatin sponge, and they showed excellent hemostatic performance in a liver defect hemostasis model. Finally, the full-thickness skin defect healing experiment results showed significant improvement in the healing process of wounds treated with the gelatin sponge loaded with exosomes compared to other groups.CONCLUSIONCollectively, the gelatin sponge loaded with hUC-MSCs-derived exosomes is safe and efficacious for promoting hemostasis and accelerating wound healing, warranting further clinical application.","2023-09-26","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:02","947-959","","9","15","","World J.

Platelets play an important and active role in the development of AS. Accumulating evidence demonstrated platelets contain diverse RNA repository inherited from megakaryocytes or microvesicles. Platelet RNAs are dynamically affected by pathological conditions and could be used as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. However, the role of the platelet RNAs in AS is elusive. In this study, we compared mRNA and circRNA profiles in platelets between AS patients and healthy controls using RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, and found 4996 mRNAs and 2942 circRNAs were differently expressed. The significantly over-expressed mRNAs in AS patients are involved in platelet activity, gap junction, focal adhesion, rapl and toll and Imd signaling pathway. The previous identified platelet-derived immune mediators such as P2Y1, P2Y12, PF4, GPIb alpha, CD40L, ICAM2, CCL5 (RANTES), TGF-beta (TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2) and PDGF (PDGFB and PDGFA) are also included in these over expressed mRNAs, implying these factors may trigger inflammatory cascades and promote the development of AS. Additionally, we found two down-regulated circRNA (circPTPN22 and circFCHSD2) from the intersection analyses of platelets and spinal ligament tissues of AS patients. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network of these two circRNAs was constructed, and the target mRNAs were enriched in Th17 cell differentiation, inflammatory bowel disease, cell adhesion molecules, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Jak-STAT and Wnt signaling pathway, all these pathways participate in the bone remodeling and pro/anti-inflammatory immune regulation in AS. Then, qRT-PCR was performed to validate the expression of selected key mRNAs and circRNAs and the results demonstrated that the expression levels of P2Y12, GPIb alpha, circPTPN22 and circFCHSD2 were consistent with the sequencing analysis. In addition, the high expression of five predicted miRNAs interacting with circPTPN22 and circFCHSD2 were also detected in AS by qRT-PCR. Taken together, our study presents a comprehensive overview of mRNAs and circRNAs in platelets in AS patients and offers new insight into the mechanisms of platelet involving in the pathogenesis of AS. The mRNAs and circRNAs identified in this study may serve as candidates for diagnosis and targeted treatment of AS.","2021-12-01","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:02","112895","","1","409","","Exp.

Bone absorption is ascribed to the imbalanced activities between osteoclasts (OCs) and osteoblasts (OBs), mechanism of which remains unclear. This study aimed to observe the condylar changes induced by OOF by mandible advancement appliance and to further investigate the role of mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) and RANKL/OPG in osteoclastic differentiation of stem cells in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, the results of micro-CT analysis indicated that condylar bone resorption was induced by OOF through mandibular advancement appliance for 2 weeks and worsened time dependently. Morphologically, cartilage thickness was reduced, subchondral cortical bone line appeared not continuous, and subchondral bone exhibited irregular-shaped and owned uneven surface. The bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) were decreased accomplished with the increased trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) determined by micro-CT. In addition, based on immunofluorescent labeling, OOF activated both OCs and OBs, but osteoclastogenesis prevailed over osteogenesis. The mTOR activation and ratio of RANKL/OPG in OBs were elevated by OOF. In vitro, the results of western blot and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) consistently suggested that the mTOR and RANKL/OPG ratio were upregulated by overloaded mechanical stretch. Pretreatment with mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, could attenuate the activation of mTOR and the secretion of RANKL in OBs. Interestingly, based on the Trap staining, the supernatant of OBs exposed to OOF could promote osteoclastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), while its role was weakened by inhibition of mTOR in OBs. Collectively, OOF induced condylar bone absorption; in the process, osteoclastogenesis was prominent than osteogenesis. The activation of mTOR and secretion of RANKL/OPG were enhanced by OOF and were involved in promoting MSCs differentiating into OCs.","2021-01-01","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:02","29-38","","1","30","","Stem Cells Dev.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 10 Place: New Rochelle Publisher: Mary Ann Liebert, Inc Web of Science ID: WOS:000599869100001","","","","","BETA; BIOGENESIS; CLASS-II; EXOSOMES; mesenchymal stem cells; mTOR; osteoblasts; osteoclastogenesis; overloaded orthopedic force","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, traditional hydrogels with nano-sized pores lead to poor cell and tissue infiltration. Furthermore, hydrogels that can stimulate each phase of cartilage regeneration to enhance cartilage repair are highly demanded. Herein, a macro-porous hydrogel is fabricated by crosslinking mixed sodium alginate (SA) and hyaluronic acid (HA) solution into SA/HA micro-fibers (mu-fibers) first and subsequently crosslinking the mu-fibers into hydrogel blocks. Besides, exosomes derived from NR8383 cells activated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and stimulated with bioglass (BG) ion extracts (LPS/BG-exo) are incorporated into the hydrogel as they exhibit a strong ability to regulate inflammation homeostasis and recruit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs). Meanwhile, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres containing kartogenin (KGN) (PLGA(KGN)) are encapsulated within the hydrogel for inducing the chondrogenic differentiation of recruited BMMSCs when KGN is released after the LPS/BG-exo. Thus, the obtained macro-porous SA/HA(exo)-PLGA(KGN) hydrogel can not only significantly improve the infiltration of tissues into the hydrogel but also sequentially deliver LPS/BG-exo and KGN to enhance the cartilage regeneration in a rat cartilage defect model.

The balance between bone matrix formation by mesenchymal lineage osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts is vital for orofacial bone development. Although the mechanisms of orofacial mesenchymal stem cells (OMSCs) in orofacial bone development have been studied intensively, the communication between OMSCs and osteoclasts remains largely unclear. Methods: We used a neural crest cell-specific knockout mouse model to investigate orofacial bone development in GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA4) morphants. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of OMSCs-derived exosomes (OMExos) on osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption activity in vitro. miRNAs were extracted from OMExos, and differences in miRNA abundances were determined using an Affymetrix miRNA array. Luciferase reporter assays were used to validate the binding between GATA4 and miR-206-3p in OMSCs and to confirm the putative binding of miR-206-3p and its target genes in OMSCs and osteoclasts. The regulatory mechanism of the GATA4-miR-206-3p axis in OMSC osteogenic differentiation and osteoclastogenesis was examined in vitro and in vivo. Results: Wnt1-Cre;Gata4(fl/fl) mice (cKO) not only presented inhibited bone formation but also showed active bone resorption. Osteoclasts cocultured in vitro with cKO OMSCs presented an increased capacity for osteoclastogenesis, which was exosome-dependent. Affymetrix miRNA array analysis showed that miR-206-3p was downregulated in exosomes from shGATA4 OMSCs. Moreover, the transcriptional activity of miR-206-3p was directly regulated by GATA4 in OMSCs. We further demonstrated that miR-206-3p played a key role in the regulation of orofacial bone development by directly targeting bone morphogenetic protein-3 (Bmp3) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). OMExos and agomiR-206-3p enhanced bone mass in Wnt1-cre;Gata4(fl/fl) mice by augmenting trabecular bone structure and decreasing osteoclast numbers. Conclusion: Our findings confirm that miR-206-3p is an important downstream factor of GATA4 that regulates the functions of OMSCs and osteoclasts. These results demonstrate the efficiency of OMExos and microRNA agomirs in promoting bone regeneration, which provide an ideal therapeutic tool for orofacial bone deformities in the future.","2021","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:02","8379-8395","","17","11","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science","","Num Pages: 17 Place: Lake Haven Publisher: Ivyspring Int Publ Web of Science ID: WOS:000678515500017","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\MG5VEN9I\Guo et al. - 2021 - GATA4-driven miR-206-3p signatures control orofaci.pdf","","","CRANIAL NEURAL CREST; DEFICIENCY; DIFFERENTIATION; EXOSOMES; EXPRESSION; GATA4; MICRORNAS; PROTEIN-3; STEM-CELLS; TOOTH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are a type of mesenchymal stem cells which play crucial roles in bone repair. The adipogenic/osteogenic differentiation disorder of BMSCs has been widely perceived contributing to SONFH. However, the regulatory mechanism of BMSCs differentiation disorder still remains unclear. Circular RNA (circRNA), a kind of stable ncRNA, plays important roles in regulating gene expression via various ways. To date, there are no studies to uncover the circRNA expression profile and screen out the key circRNAs playing crucial roles in adipogenic/osteogenic differentiation disorder of SONFH-BMSCs. In present study, we detected the circRNA expression profiles in SONFH-BMSCs for the first time. A total of 820 circRNAs were differentially expressed in SONFH-BMSCs, including 460 up- and 360 down-regulated circRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis indicates circRNA CDR1as, one up-regulated circRNA, may play crucial role in adipogenic/osteogenic differentiation disorder of SONFH-BMSCs via CDR1as-miR-7-5p-WNT5B axis. Knocking-down CDR1as resulted in increasing of osteogenic differentiation and decreasing of adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs, while over-expressing CDR1as resulted in decreasing of osteogenic differentiation and increasing of adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs.

Recent studies suggested that transplantation of CD34(+) stem cell-derived exosomes (CD34(+)-Exos) can treat ischemic diseases by promoting neovascularization and that miR-26a is an important positive regulator of osteogenesis. Moreover, the biological effect of exosomes is closely related to their cargo miRNAs. However, it is not clear whether increasing the abundance of miR-26a in CD34(+)-Exos will inhibit the progress of GC-induced ONFH. Methods MiR-26a was overexpressed in CD34(+)-Exos (miR-26a-CD34(+)-Exos) to increase their osteogenic potential. The angiogenic potential of miR-26a-CD34(+)-Exos was then examined through evaluations of migration and tube-forming capacities in vitro. In addition, in order to observe the osteogenic effect of miR-26a-CD34(+)-Exos on bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), Alizarin red staining, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assays, and qPCR were carried out. Finally, miR-26a-CD34(+)-Exos were injected into a GC-induced ONFH rat model to prevent the progress of GC-induced ONFH. The biological effects of miR-26a-CD34(+)-Exos on the ONFH model were evaluated by micro-CT, angiography, and histological staining. Results Our data showed that miR-26a-CD34(+)-Exos enhanced human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration and tube-forming capacities. Furthermore, miR-26a-CD34(+)-Exos strengthened the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs under the influence of GCs in vitro. Finally, the miR-26a-CD34(+)-Exos increased the vessel density and trabecular bone integrity of the femoral head in the GC-induced ONFH rat model, which inhibited the progress of ONFH. Conclusions MiR-26a-CD34(+)-Exos protect the femoral head from damage caused by GCs by strengthening angiogenesis and osteogenesis. The biological effect of miR-26a-CD34(+)-Exos make them suitable for application in the prevention of GC-induced ONFH.","2019-11-15","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:03","321","","1","10","","Stem Cell Res.

In this study, we investigated whether the exosomal lncRNA H19 could act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to potentiate osteochondral activity in chondrocytes. Methods Dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were carried to verify the interaction between miR-29b-3p and both lncRNA H19 and the target mRNA FoxO3. Chondrocytes were treated with UMSC-derived exosomes, which highly expressing lncRNA H19 expression, followed by apoptosis, migration, senescence, and matrix secretion assessments. An in vivo SD rat cartilage defect model was carried out to explore the role and mechanism of lncRNA H19/miR-29b-3p. Results UMSCs were successfully identified, and exosomes were successfully extracted. Exosomes exhibited the ability to transfer lncRNA H19 to chondrocytes. Mechanistically, exosomal lncRNA H19 potentiated osteochondral activity by acting as a competing endogenous sponge of miR-29b-3p, and miR-29b-3p directly targeted FoxO3. Intra-articular injection of exosomes overexpressing lncRNA H19 could promote sustained cartilage repair; however, this effect could be undermined by miR-29b-3p agomir. Conclusions Our study revealed a significant role in the development of strategies against cartilage defects for UMSC-derived exosomes that overexpress lncRNA H19. Exosomal H19 was found to promote chondrocyte migration, matrix secretion, apoptosis suppression, as well as senescence suppression, both in vitro and in vivo. The specific mechanism lies in the fact that exosomal H19 acts as a ceRNA against miR-29b-3p to upregulate FoxO3 in chondrocytes.","2021-01","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:03","e255","","1","11","","Clin.

Exosome (Exo) carrying miRNA has been proven to be a suitable nanocarrier for solving this problem. In this study, we explored whether exosomes overexpressing miR-181b (Exo-181b) could exert beneficial effect on promoting M2 macrophage polarization, thus inhibiting inflammation as well as promoting osteogenesis and elaborated the underlying mechanism in vitro. Furthermore, we aimed to find whether Exo-181b could enhance osteointegration. Results: In vitro, we firstly verified that Exo-181b significantly enhanced M2 polarization and inhibited inflammation by suppressing PRKCD and activating p-AKT. Then, in vivo, we verified that Exo-181b enhanced M2 polarization, reduced the inflammatory response and enhanced osteointegration. Also, we verified that the enhanced M2 polarization could indirectly promote the migration and osteogenic differentiation by secreting VEGF and BMP-2 in vitro. Conclusions: Exo-181b could suppress inflammatory response by promoting M2 polarization via activating PRKCD/ AKT signaling pathway, which further promoting osteogenesis in vitro and promote osteointegration in vivo.","2021-09-07","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:03","269","","1","19","","J.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is known to facilitate enhanced wound healing, yet the mechanisms underlying its activity are poorly understood. To explore these mechanisms, we first isolated PRP-derived Exos (PRP-Exos). Using immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) treated with PBS, PRP, or PRP-Exos, we conducted a series of in vitro Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), EdU, scratch wound, and transwell assays. We then established a wound defect model in vivo in mice and assessed differences in the mRNA expression within these wounds to better understand the basis for PRP-mediated wound healing. The functions of PRP-Exos and USP15 in the context of wound healing were then confirmed through additional in vitro and in vivo experiments. We found that PRP-Exos effectively promoted the in vitro proliferation, migration, and wound healing activity of HaCaT cells. USP15 was further identified as a key mediator through which these PRP-Exos were able to promote tissue repair both in vitro and in vivo. At a mechanistic level, USP15 enhanced the functional properties of HaCaT cells by promoting EIF4A1 deubiquitination. Thus, PRP-Exos and USP15 represent promising tools that can promote wound healing via enhancing epithelial regeneration.","2021-08-10","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:04","2024-01-26 18:27:03","9674809","","","2021","","Oxidative Med.

Optimization of injectability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, and controlled drug release are also features of such scaffolds. The 3D shape of the scaffold can control cell interaction and improve cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Exosomes (EXOs) are nanovesicles that can regulate osteoblast activity and proliferation using a complex composition of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids in their vesicles. Due to their excellent biocompatibility and efficient cellular internalization, EXOs have enormous potential as desirable drug/gene delivery vectors in the field of regenerative medicine. They can cross the biological barrier with minimal immunogenicity and side effects. Scaffolds that contain EXOs have been studied extensively in both basic and preclinical settings for the regeneration and repair of both hard (bone, cartilage) and soft (skin, heart, liver, kidney) tissue. Cell motility, proliferation, phenotype, and maturation can all be controlled by EXOs. The angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of EXOs significantly influence tissue healing.

This study aimed to evaluate the potential use of a new surface-structured bacterial cellulose(S-BC) biomaterial with human urine-derived stem cells (hUSCs) for wound healing. In vitro, EA.hy926 were inoculated on structured/non-structured bacterial cellulose, and the growth of EA.hy926 on bacterial cellulose in medium with/without conditioned medium of the hUSCs were observed to explore the effect of bacterial cellulose's surface structure and hUSCs-CM on vascular endothelial cell growth. In vivo, we covered wound surface with various BC materials and/or injected the hUSCs into the wound site on group BC, group S-BC, group hUSCs, group BC + hUSCs, group S-BC + hUSCs to evaluate the effect of S-BC and hUSCs on wound healing in rat full-thickness skin defect model. In vitro study, surface structure of S-BC could promote the growth and survival of EA.hy926, and the hUSCs-CM could further promote the proliferation of EA.hy926 on S-BC. In vivo study, wound healing rate of the group BC, group S-BC, group hUSCs was significantly accelerated, accompanied by faster re-epithelialization, collagen production and neovascularization than control group. It is note worthy that the effect of S-BC on wound healing was better than BC, the effect of S-BC + hUSCs on wound healing was better than BC + hUSCs. Moreover, the effect of S-BC combined with hUSCs on wound is better than treated with S-BC or hUSCs alone. All the findings suggest that the combination of S-BC and hUSCs could facilitate skin wound healing by promoting angiogenesis. This combination of the role of stem cells and biomaterial surface structures may provide a new way to address clinical wound healing problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we describe the beneficial effects of yam-derived exosome-like nanovesicles (YNVs) on promoting differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts for bone regeneration in ovariectomized (OVX)-induced osteoporotic mice. YNVs were successfully isolated and characterized. YNVs stimulate the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblasts with increased bone differentiation markers (OPN, ALP, and COLI). Interestingly, YNVs do not contain saponins including diosgenin and dioscin known to mainly exert osteogenic activity of yams. Instead, the osteogenic activity of YNVs was revealed to be resulted from activation of the BMP-2/p-p38-dependent Runx2 pathway. As a result, YNVs promote longitudinal bone growth and mineral density of the tibia in the OVX-induced osteoporotic mice in vivo, and these results positively correlate the significant increases in osteoblast-related parameters. In addition, the orally administered YNVs were transported through the GI tract and absorbed through the small intestine. These results showed an excellent systemic biosafety determined by histological analysis and liver/kidney toxicity tests.

In experimental colitis mouse models established by dextran sulfate sodium and IL-10 knockout induced with piroxicam, bone mass and quality are significantly decreased. Colitis mice demonstrate a lower bone formation rate and fewer osteoblasts in femur. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BMSCs) from colitis mice tend to differentiate into adipocytes rather than osteoblasts. Serum from patients with IBD promotes adipogenesis of human BMSCs. RNA sequencing reveals that colitis downregulates Wnt signaling in BMSCs. For treatment, exosomes with Golgi glycoprotein 1 inserted could carry Wnt agonist 1 and accumulate in bone via intravenous administration. They could alleviate bone loss, promote bone formation, and accelerate fracture healing in colitis mice.

The engineered exosomes BT-Exo-siShn3, took advantage of the intrinsic anti-osteoporosis function of these special MSC-derived exosomes and collaborated with the loaded siRNA of the Shn3 gene to enhance the therapeutic effects. Modification of a bone-targeting peptide endowed the BT-Exo-siShn3 an ability to deliver siRNA to osteoblasts specifically.

Several lines of evidence demonstrate that macrophages contribute to the immunological regulation of MSC and osteoblast function during bone regeneration. Recent studies demonstrate that macrophage polarization influences this regulatory process. In this manuscript, we investigated the paracrine functional role of naïve (M0), M1 and M2 polarized macrophage derived EVs in bone repair. Treatment of rat calvaria defects with no EVs, M0 EVs, M1 EVs, or M2 EVs revealed polarization-specific control of bone regeneration by macrophage EVs at 3 and 6 weeks. M0 and M2 EVs promoted repair/regeneration and M1 EVs inhibited bone repair. Pathway-specific studies conducted in cell culture showed that M1 EVs negatively regulated the BMP signaling pathway, specifically BMP2 and BMP9. In parallel, miRNA sequencing studies showed similar miRNA cargo in M0 and M2 EVs and different miRNA cargo in M1 EVs. Functional examination of M1 macrophage EV-enriched miR-155 demonstrated that miR-155 mimic treatment reduced MSC osteogenic differentiation as measured by reduced BMP2, BMP9 and RUNX2 expression when compared to controls. Conversely, treatment of MSCs with the M2 macrophage EV-enriched miR-378a mimic increased MSC osteoinductive gene expression when compared to controls. These functional studies implicate polarized macrophage EV miRNAs in the positive or negative regulation of bone regeneration that was observed in vivo. Overall, the results presented in this study indicate that macrophage polarization influences EV cargo and related EV function in the paracrine regulation of bone regeneration.","2020-12","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","115627","","","141","","Bone","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32891867 PMCID: PMC8107826","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\W524ZUII\Kang et al. - 2020 - Bone regeneration is mediated by macrophage extrac.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32891867","","Animals; Bone Regeneration; Bone repair; Exosomes; Extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Macrophages; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; MicroRNAs; Monocytes; Osteogenesis; Rats","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recent progress in tissue engineering technologies and stem cell biology has significantly promoted the development of regenerative reconstruction of jawbone defects. The multiple trophic activities of extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may play a critical role in their therapeutic effects. Accumulating evidence has shown the promise of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in bone regeneration, but less is known about the regenerative effects of DPSC-EVs on jawbone defects. The purpose of this study is to explore the osteogenic effects of DPSC-EVs on jawbone marrow-derived MSCs (JB-MSCs) in vitro and their osteoinductive effects in a mandibular bone defect model in rats. Our results showed that JB-MSCs could efficiently uptake DPSC-EVs, which in turn significantly promoted the expression of osteogenic genes, such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteocalcin (OCN), as well as the osteogenic differentiation capability of JB-MSCs. Meanwhile, we found that the pro-osteogenic effect in vitro induced by DPSC-EVs was comparable to that induced by BMP-2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2), currently the only Food and Drug Administration-approved osteoinductive growth factor. In vivo, animals that were locally treated with DPSC-EVs laden with a commercially available collagen membrane exhibited a relatively fast wound closure and increased new bone density at the mandible defects. Our results provide evidence for the osteogenic and osteoinductive effects of DPSC-EVs on jawbone regeneration. Due to the accessibility, rapid proliferation, and osteogenic propensity of DPSCs, DPSC-EVs may represent a safe cell-free therapeutic approach for craniofacial bone regeneration.","2023-03","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","313-321","","3","102","","J Dent Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36348514","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36348514","","Animals; Bone Regeneration; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Dental Pulp; exosome; Extracellular Vesicles; Mandible; mandibular bone; mesenchymal stem cell; Osteogenesis; osteoinduction; Rats; scaffolds; tissue engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we extracted the M2-exosomes and used them to intervene the bone repair in diabetic fractures.

The BMSC-sEV was isolated by the Exosome Isolation™ reagent and identified by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and Western blotting. The human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) were cocultured with BMSC-sEV in vitro to detect the effects of BMSC-sEV on hPDLC migration, proliferation, and differentiation. The BMSC-sEV loaded by hydrogel was injected into experimental periodontitis rats to verify the therapeutic effect and possible mechanism. The results showed that BMSC-sEVs were 30-150 nm vesicles and expressed the exosome protein CD63 and tumor susceptibility 101 (TSG101), which could promote the migration, proliferation, osteogenic differentiation of hPDLCs. The BMSC-sEV-hydrogel had a therapeutic effect on periodontitis rats. After administration for 4-8 weeks, microcomputed tomography and histological analysis showed that alveolar bone loss, inflammatory infiltration, and collagen destruction in the BMSC-sEV-hydrogel group were less than that in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-hydrogel group and periodontitis group. Further immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining revealed that the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells and the expression ratio of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor-activator of nuclear factor kappa beta ligand (RANKL) in the BMSC-sEV-hydrogel group were lower than that in the PBS-hydrogel group and periodontitis group, while the expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) and the ratio of macrophage type 2 and macrophage type 1 (M2/M1) were opposite. Therefore, BMSC-sEV can promote the regeneration of periodontal tissues, and that may be partly due to BMSC-sEV involvement in the OPG-RANKL-RANK signaling pathway to regulate the function of osteoclasts and affect the macrophage polarization and TGF-β1 expression to modulate the inflammatory immune response, thereby inhibiting the development of periodontitis and immune damage of periodontal tissue. Impact statement Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (BMSCs-sEVs) have been proven to have similar functions to BMSCs, such as promoting the regeneration of heart, liver, kidney, and bone tissue and regulating immune responses. BMSCs are candidate seed cells of periodontal regeneration, but it is unclear about the role of BMSC-sEV on periodontal regeneration.

However, the reports on the application of MSC-derived exosomes in the repair of large bone defects are sparse. In this study, we encapsulated umbilical MSC-derived exosomes (uMSCEXOs) in hyaluronic acid hydrogel (HA-Gel) and combined them with customized nanohydroxyapatite/poly-ε-caprolactone (nHP) scaffolds to repair cranial defects in rats. Imaging and histological evaluation indicated that the uMSCEXOs/Gel/nHP composites markedly enhanced bone regeneration in vivo, and the uMSCEXOs might play a key role in this process. Moreover, the in vitro results demonstrated that uMSCEXOs promoted the proliferation, migration, and angiogenic differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) but did not significantly affect the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Importantly, mechanistic studies revealed that exosomal miR-21 was the potential intercellular messenger that promoted angiogenesis by upregulating the NOTCH1/DLL4 pathway.

Macrophages in the microenvironment are instrumental in bone metabolism. Amount evidence have revealed that exosomes transmitting lncRNA is crucial nanocarriers for cellular interactions in various biotic procedures, especially, osteogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms of the regulatory relationship between the exosomes and macrophages are awaiting clarification. In the present time study, we aimed to explore the roles of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)-derived exosomes carrying nuclear enrichment enriched transcript 1 (NEAT1) in the osteogenesis mediated by M2 polarized macrophages and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: We demonstrated HUVECs-derived exosomes expressing NEAT1 significantly enhanced M2 polarization and attenuated LPS-induced inflammation in vitro. Besides, the conditioned medium from macrophages induced by the exosomes indirectly facilitated the migration and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Mechanically, Exos carrying NEAT1 decreased remarkably both expression of dead-box helicase 3X-linked (DDX3X) and nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3). The level of NLRP3 protein increased significantly after RAW264.7 cells transfected with DDX3X overexpression plasmid. Additionally, the knockdown of NEAT1 in exosomes partially counteracted the aforementioned effect of Exos. The results of air pouch rat model demonstrated that HUVECs-derived exosomes increased anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6) significantly in vivo, contributing to amelioration of LPS-induced inflammation. Afterwards, we further confirmed that the HUVECs-derived exosomes encapsulated in alginate/gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels could promote the bone regeneration, facilitate the angiogenesis, increase the infiltration of M2 polarized macrophages as well as decrease NLRP3 expression in the rat calvarial defect model. CONCLUSIONS: HUVECs-derived exosomes enable transmitting NEAT1 to alleviate inflammation by inducing M2 polarization of macrophages through DDX3X/NLRP3 regulatory axis, which finally contributes to osteogenesis with the aid of alginate/GelMA IPN hydrogels in vivo. Thus, our study provides insights in bone healing with the aid of HUVECs-derived exosomes-encapsulated composite hydrogels, which exhibited potential towards the use of bone tissue engineering in the foreseeable future.","2023-03-20","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","98","","1","21","","J Nanobiotechnology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36941678 PMCID: PMC10029245","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\NDA67FAH\Chen et al. - 2023 - Exosomal Lnc NEAT1 from endothelial cells promote .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36941678","","Animals; Bone Regeneration; Cytokines; DEAD-box RNA Helicases; Exosome; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Hydrogels; Inflammation; Lipopolysaccharides; Macrophage polarization; Macrophages; NEAT1; NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein; Osteogenesis; Rats; RNA, Long Noncoding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing was used to identify immune cells in fracture tissues, including neutrophils, monocytes, T cells, B cells, and plasma cells. The number of B cells decreased significantly in the early stage of fracture healing. Furthermore, B cells in mice fracture models decreased significantly during the epiphyseal phase and then gradually returned to normal during the epiphyseal transformation phase of fracture healing. The B-cell pattern was opposite to that of bone formation and resorption activities. Notably, B-cell-derived exosomes inhibited bone homeostasis in fracture healing. In humans, a decrease in the number of B cells during the epiphyseal phase stimulated fracture healing. Then, as the numbers of osteoblasts increased during the callus reconstruction stage, the number of B cells gradually recovered, which reduced additional bone regeneration. Thus, B cells are key regulators of fracture healing and inhibit excessive bone regeneration by producing multiple osteoblast inhibitors.","2021","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","666140","","","12","","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34819916 PMCID: PMC8606664","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\GVQU68L5\Zhang et al. - 2021 - Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Reveals B Cells Are Imp.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34819916","","Animals; B cells; B-Lymphocytes; bone marrow; Cell Communication; Cell Line; exosome; Exosomes; fracture healing; Fracture Healing; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; scRNA-seq; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Single-Cell Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Platelet lysates (PL) as a pool of growth factors (GFs) were widely used in local bone repair by its potent pro-regeneration and pro-angiogenesis. However, it is still seldom applied for treating systemic osteopathia due to the lack of a suitable delivery strategy. The non-targeted distribution of GFs might cause tumorigenesis in other organs.

The in vitro hydroxyapatite binding affinity and in vivo bone targeting aggregation of PL-exo were significantly enhanced after ALN modification. Besides directly modulating the osteogenic and angiogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), respectively, PL-exo-ALN also facilitate their coupling under GCs' stimulation.

Conventional strategies primarily combine bone scaffolds with seed cells and growth factors to modulate osteogenesis and angiogenesis.

Exosomes are nano-sized (50-200 nm) extracellular vesicles with a complex composition of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, which are attractive as therapeutic nanoparticles for disease treatment. Exosomes also have huge potential as desirable drug/gene delivery vectors in the field of regenerative medicine due to their excellent biocompatibility and efficient cellular internalization. Methods: We developed a cell-free tissue engineering system using functional exosomes in place of seed cells. Gene-activated engineered exosomes were constructed by using ATDC5-derived exosomes to encapsulate the VEGF gene. The specific exosomal anchor peptide CP05 acted as a flexible linker and effectively combined the engineered exosome nanoparticles with 3D-printed porous bone scaffolds. Results: Our findings demonstrated that engineered exosomes play dual roles as an osteogenic matrix to induce the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and as a gene vector to controllably release the VEGF gene to remodel the vascular system. In vivo evaluation further verified that the engineered exosome-mediated bone scaffolds could effectively induce the bulk of vascularized bone regeneration.

Although cell-based treatments have shown therapeutic effects for osteoporosis, there are still some limitations inhibiting the process of clinical application. In the present study, we developed EVs derived from skeletal muscle tissues (Mu-EVs) as a cell-free therapy to treat disuse-induced osteoporosis. Our results showed that Mu-EVs could be prepared easily and abundantly from skeletal muscle tissues, and that these Mu-EVs had typical features of extracellular vesicles. In vitro studies demonstrated that Mu-EVs from normal skeletal muscles could be phagocytized by bone marrow stromal/stem cells (BMSCs) and osteoclasts (OCs), and promoted osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs while inhibited OCs formation. Correspondingly, Mu-EVs from atrophic skeletal muscles attenuated the osteogenesis of BMSCs and strengthened the osteoclastogenesis of monocytes. In vivo experiments revealed that Mu-EVs could efficiently reverse disuse-induced osteoporosis by enhancing bone formation and suppressing bone resorption. Collectively, our results suggest that Mu-EVs may be a potential cell-free therapy for osteoporosis treatment.

We next investigated the effect and potential mechanism of sEVs on the effects of osteogenesis and angiogenesis. We fabricated 3D-printed bioglass scaffold with Gelma/nanoclay hydrogel coatings to load sEVs (BG-gel-sEVs) to ensure in vivo sustained efficacy of sEVs. Finally, the skull defect model was used to evaluate the capacity of vascularized bone regeneration of the composited scaffolds.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exosomes enriched with miR-375 (Exo [miR-375]) were generated from hASCs stably overexpressing miR-375 after lentiviral transfection and identified with transmission electron microscopy, nanosight and western blotting. The construction efficiency of Exo (miR-375) was evaluated with qRT-PCR and incubated with human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) to optimize the effective dosage. Then, the osteogenic capability of Exo (miR-375) was investigated with ALP and ARS assays. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blotting were conducted to reveal the underlying mechanism of miR-375 in osteogenic regulation. Finally, Exo (miR-375) were embedded with hydrogel and applied to a rat model of calvarial defect, and μ-CT analysis and histological examination were conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Exo (miR-375) in bone regeneration. RESULTS: miR-375 could be enriched in exosomes by overexpressing in the parent cells. Administration of Exo (miR-375) at 50 μg/mL improved the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. With miR-375 absorbed by hBMSCs, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) was inhibited by binding to its 3'UTR, and recombinant IGFBP3 protein reduced the osteogenic effects triggered by Exo (miR-375). After incorporated with hydrogel, Exo (miR-375) displayed a slow and controlled release, and further in vivo analysis demonstrated that Exo (miR-375) enhanced the bone regenerative capacity in a rat model of calvarial defect.

Herein, a novel bioinspired double-network hydrogel scaffold produced via 3D printing with tissue-specific decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) and human adipose mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes is described. The bionic hydrogel scaffolds promote rat bone marrow MSC attachment, spread, migration, proliferation, and chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation in vitro, as determined based on the sustained release of bioactive exosomes. Furthermore, the 3D-printed microenvironment-specific heterogeneous bilayer scaffolds efficiently accelerate the simultaneous regeneration of cartilage and subchondral bone tissues in a rat preclinical model. In conclusion, 3D dECM-based microenvironment-specific biomimetics encapsulated with bioactive exosomes can serve as a novel cell-free recipe for stem cell therapy when treating injured or degenerative joints.

Compared with Con-Exo, exosomes secreted by bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) in conventional culture medium, the engineered Li-Exo, exosomes derived from bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) stimulated by lithium ions, promoted macrophage M2 polarization while inhibiting macrophage M1 polarization. Furthermore, inspired by the fact that hydrogels can serve as desirable carriers of exosomes to facilitate their release in a sustained manner for improved therapeutic efficiency and in vivo application, an extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimicking hydrogel (Lightgel) composed of methacryloylated type I collagen was employed to incorporate Li-Exo/Con-Exo to construct the Lightgel-Li-Exo hydrogel/Lightgel-Con-Exo hydrogel.

Exosomes emerge as essential paracrine factors of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that mediated tissue regeneration. Here, we investigated the potential of exosomes secreted by periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) as therapeutics for the bone defect in periodontitis. Exosomes secreted from PDLSCs derived from healthy periodontal ligaments (h-PDLSCs) and their function were evaluated on PDLSCs isolated from the inflammatory periodontal ligament of periodontitis patients (i-PDLSCs). Treatment of exosomes of h-PDLSCs led to an increase in the formation of mineralized nodules and the expressions of osteogenic genes and proteins in i-PDLSCs. Mechanistically, h-PDLSCs-exosomes suppressed the over-activation of canonical Wnt signaling to recover the osteogenic differentiation capacity of i-PDLSCs. To evaluate the therapeutic of exosomes on inflammatory bone loss, h-PDLSCs-exosomes loaded with Matrigel or β-TCP were employed to repair bone defects in rat models of periodontitis. Compared to the vehicle-treated control group, h-PDLSCs-exosomes-treated rats resulted in more bone formation in the defect of alveolar bone. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that exosomes derived from healthy PDLSCs could rescue the osteogenesis capacity of endogenous stem cells under an inflammatory environment and promote regeneration of alveolar bone. Our findings suggest that MSCs-derived exosome is an effective and practical cell-free MSC therapeutic for the treatment of periodontitis.

However, the differences in the drugs carried, and the binding of EXOs to other organs limit their therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, improving the OS-targeting ability of BMSCs EXOs and developing new drugs is crucial for the clinical application of targeted therapy for OS. RESULTS: In this study, we constructed a potential therapeutic nano platform by modifying BMSCs EXOs using the bone-targeting peptide SDSSD and encapsulated capreomycin (CAP) within a shell. These constructed nanoparticles (NPs) showed the ability of homologous targeting and bone-targeting exosomes (BT-EXO) significantly promotes cellular endocytosis in vitro and tumor accumulation in vivo. Furthermore, our results revealed that the constructed NPs induced ferroptosis in OS cells by prompting excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), Fe2+ aggregation, and lipid peroxidation and further identified the potential anticancer molecular mechanism of ferroptosis as transduced by the Keap1/Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway. Also, these constructed NP-directed ferroptosis showed significant inhibition of tumor growth in vivo with no significant side effects.

Exosomes from different human cells have shown macrophage immunomodulation-mediated bone regeneration potential. However, the effect of human serum-derived exosomes (serum-Exo) on macrophage immunomodulation-mediated angiogenesis during bone defect repair has not been investigated yet. In this study, we explored the effects of serum-Exo on macrophage inflammation regulation-mediated angiogenesis during bone defect repair and preliminarily elucidated the mechanism. Healthy serum-Exo was isolated by ultracentrifugation. The effect of serum-Exo on LPS-induced M1 macrophage inflammation was analysed in vitro. The conditioned medium of serum-Exo-treated LPS-induced M1 macrophage (serum-Exo-treated M1 macrophage-CM) was used to culture human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and the effect on angiogenesis was analysed by western blot, qRT-PCR, etc. mRNA-sequencing of HUVECs was performed to identify deferentially expressed genes. Finally, the rat mandibular defect model was established and treated with Bio-Oss and Bio-Oss + Exo. The effect of the Bio-Oss + Exo combination on mandibular bone regeneration was observed by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, Masson staining, and immunohistochemical staining. Serum-Exo promoted the proliferation of RAW264.7 macrophages and reduced the expression of M1-related genes such as IL-6, IL-1β, iNOS, and CD86. Serum-Exo-treated M1 macrophage-CM induced the proliferation, migration, and angiogenic differentiation of HUVEC, as well as the expression of H-type blood vessel markers CD31 and endomucin (EMCN), compared with M1 macrophage-CM. Moreover, higher expression of vascular endothelial adhesion factor 1 (VCAM1) in HUVEC cultured with serum-Exo-treated M1 macrophage-CM compared with M1 macrophages-CM. Inhibition of VCAM1 signalling abrogated the pro-angiogenic effect of serum-Exo-treated M1 macrophage-CM on HUVEC. Local administration of serum-Exo during mandibular bone defect repair reduced the number of M1 macrophages and promoted angiogenesis and osteogenesis.

Exosomes derived from bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC-Exos) have been confirmed to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis. The magnetic nanoparticles (eg. Fe3O4, γ-Fe2O3) combined with a static magnetic field (SMF) has been commonly used to increase wound healing and bone regeneration. Hence, this study aims to evaluate whether exosomes derived from BMSCs preconditioned with a low dose of Fe3O4 nanoparticles with or without the SMF, exert superior pro-osteogenic and pro-angiogenic activities in bone regeneration and the underlying mechanisms involved. METHODS: Two novel types of exosomes derived from preconditioned BMSCs that fabricated by regulating the contents with the stimulation of magnetic nanoparticles and/or a SMF. Then, the new exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized. Afterwards, we conducted in vitro experiments in which we measured osteogenic differentiation, cell proliferation, cell migration, and tube formation, then established an in vivo critical-sized calvarial defect rat model. The miRNA expression profiles were compared among the exosomes to detect the potential mechanism of improving osteogenesis and angiogenesis. At last, the function of exosomal miRNA during bone regeneration was confirmed by utilizing a series of gain- and loss-of-function experiments in vitro. RESULTS: 50 µg/mL Fe3O4 nanoparticles and a 100 mT SMF were chosen as the optimum magnetic conditions to fabricate two new exosomes, named BMSC-Fe3O4-Exos and BMSC-Fe3O4-SMF-Exos. They were both confirmed to enhance osteogenesis and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo compared with BMSC-Exos, and BMSC-Fe3O4-SMF-Exos had the most marked effect. The promotion effect was found to be related to the highly riched miR-1260a in BMSC-Fe3O4-SMF-Exos. Furthermore, miR-1260a was verified to enhance osteogenesis and angiogenesis through inhibition of HDAC7 and COL4A2, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that low doses of Fe3O4 nanoparticles combined with a SMF trigger exosomes to exert enhanced osteogenesis and angiogenesis and that targeting of HDAC7 and COL4A2 by exosomal miR-1260a plays a crucial role in this process.

It is increasingly accepted that MSCs mediate tissue repair through secretion of trophic factors, particularly exosomes. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effects of human MSC exosome-loaded collagen sponge for regeneration of surgically created periodontal intrabony defects in an immunocompetent rat model. We observed that relative to control rats, exosome-treated rats repaired the defects more efficiently with regeneration of periodontal tissues including newly-formed bone and periodontal ligament (PDL). We also observed that concomitant with this, there was increased cellular infiltration and proliferation. We therefore postulated that MSC exosomes enhanced regeneration through increased cellular mobilisation and proliferation. Using PDL cell cultures, we demonstrated that MSC exosomes could increase PDL cell migration and proliferation through CD73-mediated adenosine receptor activation of pro-survival AKT and ERK signalling. Inhibition of AKT or ERK phosphorylation suppressed PDL cell migration and proliferation. Our findings demonstrated for the first time that MSC exosomes enhance periodontal regeneration possibly by increasing PDL migration and proliferation. This study suggests that MSC exosome is a viable ready-to-use and cell-free MSC therapeutic for the treatment of periodontal defects.

However, translation of cellular therapies is hampered by challenges in maintaining optimal cell vitality and viability from manufacturing and storage to final delivery to patients. Although the use of MSCs for tissue repair was first predicated on their differentiation potential, the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs has increasingly been attributed to its paracrine secretion, particularly exosomes or small extracellular vesicles.

PURPOSE: To assess the effect of exosomes derived from human urine-derived stem cells (hUSCs) overexpressing miR-140-5p (miR means microRNA) on KOA in an in vitro interleukin 1β (IL-1β)-induced osteoarthritis (OA) model and an in vivo rat KOA model. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Exosomes derived from hUSCs (hUSC-Exos) were isolated and validated. The hUSCs were transfected with miR-140s using lentivirus, and exosomes secreted from such cells (hUSC-140-Exos) were collected. The roles of hUSC-Exos and hUSC-140-Exos in protecting chondrocytes against IL-1β treatment were compared by analyzing the proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) in chondrocytes. After vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) was identified as a target of miR-140, the mechanism by which VEGFA can mediate the beneficial effect of miR-140 on OA was investigated using small interfering RNA transfection or chemical drugs. The expression of VEGFA in cartilage and synovial fluid from patients with KOA was measured and compared with that of healthy controls. Surgery for anterior cruciate ligament transection and destabilization of the medial meniscus were performed on the knee joints of Sprague-Dawley rats to establish an animal model of OA, and intra-articular (IA) injection of hUSC-Exos or hUSC-140-Exos was conducted at 4 to 8 weeks after the surgery. Cartilage regeneration and subchondral bone remodeling were evaluated through histological staining and micro-computed tomography analysis. RESULTS: Proliferation and migration ability were enhanced and apoptosis was inhibited in chondrocytes treated with IL-1β via hUSC-Exos, with the side effect of decreased ECM secretion. hUSC-140-Exos not only retained the advantages of hUSC-Exos but also increased the secretion of ECM by targeting VEGFA, including collagen II and aggrecan. Increased expression of VEGFA during the progression of KOA was also confirmed in cartilage and synovial fluid samples obtained from patients with OA. In the rat OA model, IA injection of hUSC-140-Exos enhanced cartilage regeneration and subchondral bone remodeling. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the superiority of hUSC-Exos overexpressing miR-140-5p for treating OA compared with the hUSC-Exos. The effect of hUSC-140-Exos for suppressing the progression of KOA is in part mediated by VEGFA. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Exosomes derived from stem cells may provide a promising treatment for KOA, and our study can advance the related basic research.","2022-03","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","1088-1105","","4","50","","Am J Sports Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35179989","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35179989","","Animals; Chondrocytes; Down-Regulation; exosomes; Exosomes; human urine–derived stem cells; Humans; intra-articular injection; knee osteoarthritis; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; MicroRNAs; miR-140-5p; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Stem Cells; vascular endothelial growth factor A; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; X-Ray Microtomography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When MSCs are exposed to an inflammatory environment, they release more functional growth factors, exosomes, and chemokines. Herein, MSCs are stimulated to alter sEV cargos and functions to regulate the inflammatory microenvironment and promote tissue regeneration. Sequencing of sEV miRNAs shows that certain RNAs conducive to cell function are upregulated. In this study, in vitro cell function experiments show that both inflammation-stimulated adipose-derived MSC (ADSC)-derived sEV (IAE) and normal ADSC-derived sEV (AE) promote cell proliferation; IAE also significantly improves cell migration. Regarding macrophage polarization regulation, IAE significantly promotes M2 macrophage differentiation. RNA-sequencing analysis indicates that high miR-27b-3p expression levels in IAE may regulate macrophages by targeting macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). In vivo, a rabbit temporomandibular joint (TMJ) condylar osteochondral defect model shows that both AE and IAE promote TMJ regeneration, with IAE having the most significant therapeutic effect. Therefore, the authors confirm that exposing MSCs to an inflammatory environment can feasibly enhance sEV functions and that modified sEVs achieve better therapeutic effects.","2022-04","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","e2107354","","16","18","","Small","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35277920","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35277920","","Animals; extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; inflammation; Inflammation; Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Macrophages; MicroRNAs; miR-27b-3p; Rabbits; regeneration; temporomandibular joint; Temporomandibular Joint","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study shows that after TBI, injured neurons, mainly those in the hippocampus, release osteogenic microRNA (miRNA)-enriched small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), which targeted osteoprogenitors in bone to stimulate bone formation. We show that miR-328a-3p and miR-150-5p, enriched in the sEVs after TBI, promote osteogenesis by directly targeting the 3'UTR of FOXO4 or CBL, respectively, and hydrogel carrying miR-328a-3p-containing sEVs efficiently repaires bone defects in rats. Importantly, increased fibronectin expression on sEVs surface contributes to targeting of osteoprogenitors in bone by TBI sEVs, thereby implying that modification of the sEVs surface fibronectin could be used in bone-targeted drug delivery. Together, our work unveils a role of central regulation in bone formation and a clear link between injured neurons and osteogenitors, both in animals and clinical settings.","2021-10-15","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","6043","","1","12","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34654817 PMCID: PMC8519911","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\RVBUUXYL\Xia et al. - 2021 - Damaged brain accelerates bone healing by releasin.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34654817","","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Animals; Bone and Bones; Brain; Brain Injuries; Cell Line; Disease Models, Animal; Extracellular Vesicles; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Neurons; Neurophysiology; Osteogenesis; Proteomics; Rats; Rheumatic Diseases; Wound Healing; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, new treatments are needed to develop regeneration procedures without side effects. Exosomes secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs, hiPSC-MSC-Exos) incorporate the advantages of both MSCs and iPSCs with no immunogenicity. However, there are no reports on the application of hiPSC-MSC-Exos to enhance angiogenesis and osteogenesis under osteoporotic conditions. HiPSC-MSC-Exos were isolated and identified before use. The effect of hiPSC-MSC-Exos on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow MSCs derived from ovariectomized (OVX) rats (rBMSCs-OVX) in vitro were investigated. In vivo, hiPSC-MSC-Exos were implanted into critical size bone defects in ovariectomized rats, and bone regeneration and angiogenesis were examined by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT), sequential fluorescent labeling analysis, microfil perfusion and histological and immunohistochemical analysis. The results in vitro showed that hiPSC-MSC-Exos enhanced cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and up-regulated mRNA and protein expression of osteoblast-related genes in rBMSCs-OVX. In vivo experiments revealed that hiPSC-MSC-Exos dramatically stimulated bone regeneration and angiogenesis in critical-sized calvarial defects in ovariectomized rats. The effect of hiPSC-MSC-Exos increased with increasing concentration. In this study, we showed that hiPSC-MSC-Exos effectively stimulate the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs-OVX, with the effect increasing with increasing exosome concentration.

A third major cell type in the bone is osteocytes, which are embedded in the matrix, are well-connected to the lacunar network, and are believed to act as mechanical sensors. Here, it is reported that sympathetic innervation directly regulates lacunar osteocyte-mediated bone resorption inside cortical bone. It is found that sympathetic activity is elevated in different mouse models of bone loss, including lactation, ovariectomy, and glucocorticoid treatment. Further, during lactation elevated sympathetic outflow induces netrin-1 expression by osteocytes to further promote sympathetic nerve sprouting in the cortical bone endosteum in a feed-forward loop. Depletion of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+ ) sympathetic nerves ameliorated osteocyte-mediated perilacunar bone resorption in lactating mice. Moreover, norepinephrine activates β-adrenergic receptor 2 (Adrb2) signaling to promote secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing bone-degrading enzymes for perilacunar bone resorption and inhibit osteoblast differentiation. Importantly, osteocyte-specific deletion of Adrb2 or treatment with a β-blocker results in lower bone resorption in lactating mice. Together, these findings show that the sympathetic nervous system promotes osteocyte-driven bone loss during lactation, likely as an adaptive response to the increased energy and mineral demands of the nursing mother.","2023-06","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","e2207602","","18","10","","Adv Sci (Weinh)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37186379 PMCID: PMC10288263","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\T5UYXVNH\Guo et al. - 2023 - Sympathetic Innervation Regulates Osteocyte-Mediat.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37186379","","Animals; Bone and Bones; Bone Diseases, Metabolic; Bone Resorption; Cortical Bone; cortical bone remodeling; Female; lactation; Lactation; Mice; osteocytes; Osteocytes; osteocytic bone resorption; sympathetic nerves","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we aimed to design Bmp2 mRNA-enriched engineered exosomes, which were then loaded into specific hydrogel to achieve sustained release for more efficient and safe bone regeneration. RESULTS: Bmp2 mRNA was enriched into exosomes by selective inhibition of translation in donor cells, in which NoBody (non-annotated P-body dissociating polypeptide, a protein that inhibits mRNA translation) and modified engineered BMP2 plasmids were co-transfected. The derived exosomes were named ExoBMP2+NoBody. In vitro experiments confirmed that ExoBMP2+NoBody had higher abundance of Bmp2 mRNA and thus stronger osteogenic induction capacity. When loaded into GelMA hydrogel via ally-L-glycine modified CP05 linker, the exosomes could be slowly released and thus ensure prolonged effect of BMP2 when endocytosed by the recipient cells. In the in vivo calvarial defect model, ExoBMP2+NoBody-loaded GelMA displayed great capacity in promoting bone regeneration.

Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of exosomes from pre-differentiated human alveolar bone-derived bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (AB-BMSCs) carrying specific microRNAs on bone regeneration. Exosomes secreted from AB-BMSCs pre-differentiated for 0 and 7 days were cocultured with BMSCs in vitro to investigate their effect on the differentiation of the BMSCs. MiRNAs from AB-BMSCs at different stages of osteogenic differentiation were analyzed. BMSCs seeded on poly-L-lactic acid(PLLA) scaffolds were treated with miRNA antagonist-decorated exosomes to verify their effect on new bone regeneration. Exosomes pre-differentiated for 7 days effectively promoted the differentiation of BMSCs. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that miRNAs within the exosomes were differentially expressed, including the upregulation of osteogenic miRNAs (miR-3182, miR-1468) and downregulation of anti-osteogenic miRNAs (miR-182-5p, miR-335-3p, miR-382-5p), causing activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The treatment of BMSC-seeded scaffolds with anti-miR-182-5p decorated exosomes demonstrated enhanced osteogenic differentiation and efficient formation of new bone. In conclusion, Osteogenic exosomes secreted from pre-differentiated AB-BMSCs were identified and the gene modification of exosomes provides great potential as a bone regeneration strategy.

In the natural healing process, angiogenesis precedes osteogenesis, providing a blood supply that supports the subsequent progression of osteogenesis. Developing a biomimetic scaffold that mimics the in vivo environment and promotes the proper sequence of vascularization followed by ossification is crucial for successful bone regeneration. In this study, a novel injectable dual-drug programmed releasing chitosan nanofibrous microsphere-based poly(D, l-lactide-co-glycolide)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(D,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) hydrogel is fabricated by incorporating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microspheres loaded with dental pulp stem cells-derived exosomes (DPSCs-Exo). Rapid release of VEGF promotes the swift initiation of angiogenesis, while DPSCs-Exo release ensures persistent osteogenesis. Our results demonstrate that chitosan microsphere-based PLGA-PEG-PLGA hydrogel significantly promotes angiogenesis in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and enhances the osteogenic differentiation of pre-osteoblasts. Furthermore, in vivo transplantation of this injectable chitosan microsphere-based PLGA-PEG-PLGA hydrogel into calvarial bone defects markedly promotes bone formation.

This study investigated whether exosomes from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC-Exos) plays an immunomodulatory role in traumatic bone defects and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: ADSC-Exos were loaded by a biomaterial named gelatine nanoparticles (GNPs), physical and chemical properties were analysed by zeta potential, surface topography and rheology. A rat model of skull defect was used for our in vivo studies, and micro-CT and histological staining were used to analyse histological changes in the bone defect area. RT-qPCR and western blotting were performed to verify that ADSC-Exos could regulate M1/M2 macrophage polarization. MicroRNA (miRNA) array analysis was conducted to determine the miRNA expression profiles of ADSC-Exos. After macrophages were treated with a miR-451a mimic, miR-451a inhibitor and ISO-1, the relative expression of genes and proteins was measured by RT-qPCR and western blotting. RESULTS: In vivo, micro-CT and histological staining showed that exosome-loaded GNPs (GNP-Exos) hydrogel, with good biocompatibility and strong mechanical adaptability, exhibited immunomodulatory effect mainly by regulating macrophage immunity and promoting bone tissue healing. Immunofluorescence further indicated that ADSC-Exos reduced M1 marker (iNOS) expression and increased M2 marker (CD206) expression. Moreover, in vitro studies, western blotting and RT-qPCR showed that ADSC-Exos inhibited M1 macrophage marker expression and upregulated M2 macrophage marker expression. MiR-451a was enriched in ADSC-Exos and targeted macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Macrophages treated with the miR-451a mimic showed lower expression of M1 markers. In contrast, miR-451a inhibitor treatment upregulated the expression of M1 markers and downregulated the expression of M2 markers, while ISO-1 (a MIF inhibitor) treatment upregulated miR-451a expression and downregulated M1 macrophage marker expression. CONCLUSION: GNP-Exos can effectively regulate bone immune metabolism and further promote bone healing partly through immune regulation of miR-451a, which may provide a therapeutic direction for bone repair.","2022-04-08","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","149","","1","13","","Stem Cell Res Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35395782 PMCID: PMC8994256","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\2L7AJGPR\Li et al. - 2022 - Exosomes from adipose-derived stem cells regulate .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35395782","","Adipose-derived stem cells; Animals; Bone and Bones; Bone healing; Exosomes; Inflammation; Intramolecular Oxidoreductases; Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors; Macrophages; MicroRNAs; MiRNA; Rats; Stem Cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to regenerate articular cartilage, they also have many limitations. Recent studies have found that MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) play an important role in tissue regeneration. The purpose of this study was to verify whether MSC-Exos can enhance the reparative effect of the acellular cartilage extracellular matrix (ACECM) scaffold and to explore the underlying mechanism. The results of in vitro experiments show that human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly MSC-Exos (hWJMSC-Exos) can promote the migration and proliferation of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) and the proliferation of chondrocytes. We also found that hWJMSC-Exos can promote the polarization of macrophages toward the M2 phenotype. The results of a rabbit knee osteochondral defect repair model confirmed that hWJMSC-Exos can enhance the effect of the ACECM scaffold and promote osteochondral regeneration. We demonstrated that hWJMSC-Exos can regulate the microenvironment of the articular cavity using a rat knee joint osteochondral defect model. This effect was mainly manifested in promoting the polarization of macrophages toward the M2 phenotype and inhibiting the inflammatory response, which may be a promoting factor for osteochondral regeneration. In addition, microRNA (miRNA) sequencing confirmed that hWJMSC-Exos contain many miRNAs that can promote the regeneration of hyaline cartilage.

However, current non-surgical treatment for OA can only relieve pain without obvious cartilage and subchondral bone repair. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-secreted exosomes have promising therapeutic effects on knee OA, but the efficacy of MSC-exosome therapy is not well determined, and the mechanisms involved are still unclear. In this study, we isolated dental pulp stem cell (DPSC)-derived exosomes by ultracentrifugation and determined the therapeutic effects of a single intra-articular injection of DPSC-derived exosomes in a mice knee OA model. The results showed that the DPSC-derived exosomes effectively improved abnormal subchondral bone remodeling, inhibited the occurrence of bone sclerosis and osteophytes, and alleviated cartilage degradation and synovial inflammation in vivo. Moreover, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) was activated during the progression of OA. Enhanced TRPV4 activation facilitated osteoclast differentiation, and TRPV4 inhibition blocked this process in vitro. DPSC-derived exosomes repressed osteoclast activation in vivo by inhibiting TRPV4 activation. Our findings demonstrated that a topical, single injection of DPSC-derived exosomes is a potential strategy for knee OA treatment, and that the exosomes regulated osteoclast activation by TRPV4 inhibition, which may act as a promising target for clinical OA treatment.","2023-03-03","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","4926","","5","24","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36902356 PMCID: PMC10003468","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\NI3FNMNF\Fu et al. - 2023 - Dental Pulp Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes Alleviate M.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36902356","","Animals; Cartilage, Articular; Chondrocytes; Dental Pulp; Disease Models, Animal; exosome; Exosomes; Mice; osteoarthritis; Osteoarthritis, Knee; osteoclast; Osteoclasts; Stem Cells; TRPV Cation Channels; TRPV4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing exosome (Exo) delivery strategies cannot reach the angiogenesis phase following bone injury. To that end, an enzyme-sensitive Exo delivery material that responds to neovessel formation during the angiogenesis phase was designed in the present study to achieve spatiotemporally controlled Exo release. Herein, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) was found to be highly expressed in neovascularized bone; as a result, we proposed an injectable MMP1-sensitive hydrogel microspheres (KGE) made using a microfluidic chip prepared by mixing self-assembling peptide (KLDL-MMP1), GelMA, and BMSC-Exos. The results revealed that KGE microspheres had a uniform diameter of 50-70 µm, ideal for minimally invasive injection and could release exosomes in response to MMP1 expression. In vitro experiments demonstrated that KGE had less cytotoxicity and could promote the migration and osteodifferentiation of BMSCs. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed that KGE could promote bone repair during angiogenesis by recruiting CD90+ stem cells via neovessels. Collectively, our results suggest that injectable enzyme-responsive KGE microspheres could be a promising Exo-secreting material for accelerating neovascularized bone healing. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Exosomes can spread through blood vessels and activate stem cells to participate in bone repair, but under normal circumstances, exosomes lacking sustained-release delivery materials cannot be maintained until the angiogenesis phase. In this study, we found that MMP1 was highly expressed in neovascularized bone, then we proposed an MMP1-sensitive injectable microsphere that carries exosomes and responds temporally and spatially to neovascularization, which maximizes the ability of exosomes to recruit stem cells. Different from previous strategies that focus on promoting angiogenesis to accelerate bone healing, this is a brand new delivery strategy that is stimuli-responsive to neovessel formation. In addition, the preparation of self-assembled peptide microspheres by a microfluidic chip is also proposed for the first time.","2023-02","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","321-336","","","157","","Acta Biomater","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36481504","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36481504","","Exosome; Exosomes; Injectable microsphere; Matrix Metalloproteinase 1; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Microfluidic chip; Microspheres; MMP1; Neovascularized bone healing; Self-assembling peptide; Spatiotemporally controlled","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we discover that AB-null MRL/lpr mice show resistance to breast cancer cell implantation, with more CD8+ T cell infiltrations and a higher survival rate. We uncover that the membranous Siglec15 on osteoclast-derived ABs binds with sialylated Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and blocks downstream co-stimulatory signaling, leading to the inhibition of naive CD8+ T cell activation. In addition, our study shows that treatment with Siglec15 neutralizing antibodies significantly reduces the incidence of secondary metastases and improves the survival rate of mice with advanced breast cancer bone metastasis.

To determine the effect of diabetic microenvironment on EVs secreted by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), this work explores the effect of normal glucose (5.5 mm) cultured BMSCs derived EVs (NG-EVs) and high glucose (30 mm) cultured BMSCs derived EVs (HG-EVs) in regulating the migration, proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. In order to improve the bioavailability of EVs, this work constructs a sustained release system of polydopamine (PDA) functionalized 3D printing gelatin/hyaluronic acid/nano-hydroxyapatite (Gel/HA/nHAP) scaffolds (S/PDA) and verifies its function in the calvarial defect model of diabetic rats. This work confirms that both NG-EVs and HG-EVs can promote proliferation and migration, inhibit apoptosis and promote osteogenic differentiation, but the function of HG-EVs is weaker than that of NG-EVs. Therefore, EVs secreted by autologous cells of diabetic patients are not suitable for self-repair.

Recent studies have shown that tendon regeneration and repair rely on multiple specific transcription factors to maintain TSPCs characteristics and functions. Here, we demonstrate Yap, a Hippo pathway downstream effector, is associated with TSPCs phenotype and regenerative potentials through gene expression analysis of tendon development and repair process. Exosomes have been proven an efficient transport platform for drug delivery. In this study, purified exosomes derived from donor platelets are loaded with recombinant Yap1 protein (PLT-Exo-Yap1) via electroporation to promote the stemness and differentiation potentials of TSPCs in vitro. Programmed TSPCs with Yap1 import maintain stemness and functions after long-term passage in vitro. The increased oxidative stress levels of TSPCs are related to the phenotype changes in duplicative senescent processes. The results show that treatment with PLT-Exo-Yap1 significantly protects TSPCs against oxidative stressor-induced stemness loss and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) through the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, we fabricate an Exos-Yap1-functioned GelMA hydrogel with a parallel-aligned substrate structure to enhance TSPCs adhesion, promote cell stemness and force regenerative cells toward the tendon lineage for in vitro and in vivo tendon regeneration. The application of Exos-Yap1 functioned implant assists new tendon-like tissue formation with good mechanical properties and locomotor functions in a full-cut Achilles tendon defect model. Thus, PLT-Exo-Yap1-functionalized GelMA promotes the rejuvenation of TSPCs to facilitate functional tendon regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to explore that the hippo pathway downstream effector Yap is involved in tendon aging and repair processes, and is associated with the regenerative capabilities of TSPCs. In this syudy, Platelet-derived exosomes (PLT-Exos) act as an appropriate carrier platform for the delivery of recombinant Yap1 into TSPCs to regulate Yap activity. Effective Yap1 delivery inhibit oxidative stress-induced senescence associated phenotype of TSPCs by blocking ROS-mediated NF-κb signaling pathway activation. This study emphasizes that combined application of biomimetic scaffolds and Yap1 loaded PLT-Exos can provide structural support and promote rejuvenation of resident cells to assist functional regeneration for Achilles tendon defect, and has the prospect of clinical setting.","2023-04-15","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","80-99","","","161","","Acta Biomater","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36804538","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36804538","","Achilles Tendon; Blood Platelets; Cell Proliferation; Exosomes; NF-kappa B; Platelet-derived exosome; Regeneration; Rejuvenation; Stem Cells; Tendon regeneration; Transcription Factors; TSPCs; Yap1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current treatments for OA are limited to alleviating symptoms, with no therapies that prevent and regenerate cartilage deterioration. PURPOSE: To assess the effects of platelet-derived exosomes (Plt-exos) on OA and then to explore the potential molecular mechanism. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Exosomes derived from human apheresis platelets were isolated and identified. The effects of Plt-exos in protecting chondrocytes under interleukin 1β stimulation were evaluated by analyzing the proliferation and migration in human primary chondrocytes. RNA sequencing was later performed in vitro for primary chondrocytes to reveal the underlying mechanisms of Plt-exo treatment. Anterior cruciate ligament transection was used to construct an OA mice model, and intra-articular injection of Plt-exos was given once a week for 6 weeks. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after the last injection. Histologic and immunohistochemistry staining and micro-computed tomography analysis were performed to assess alterations of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. RESULTS: Plt-exos significantly promoted proliferation and migration of chondrocytes within a dose-dependent manner, as well as dramatically promoted cartilage regeneration and attenuated abnormal tibial subchondral bone remodeling, thus slowing the progression of OA. After being treated with Plt-exos, 1797 genes were differentially expressed in chondrocytes (923 upregulated and 874 downregulated genes). Functional enrichment results and hub genes were mainly involved in anti-inflammatory effects, mediating cell adhesion, stimulating cartilage repair, promoting anabolism, and inhibiting catabolism. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that Plt-exos promoted chondrocyte proliferation and migration in vitro, as well as attenuated cartilage degeneration, improved the microarchitecture of subchondral bone, and retarded OA progression in vivo. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our study illustrated that the administered Plt-exos could alleviate knee OA by attenuating cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss, possibly serving as a novel promising treatment for OA in the future.","2023-09","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","2975-2985","","11","51","","Am J Sports Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37551685","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37551685","","Aged; Animals; Blood Platelets; cartilage; Cartilage Diseases; Cartilage, Articular; Chondrocytes; exosomes; Exosomes; Humans; Mice; osteoarthritis; Osteoarthritis, Knee; platelet; X-Ray Microtomography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the therapeutic effects of MSCs in tissue repair are mediated mainly through the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes, we investigated here the cellular processes and molecular mechanisms modulated by MSC exosomes in dental pulp regeneration. Using dental pulp cell (DPC) cultures, we demonstrated that MSC exosomes could increase DPC migration, proliferation, and odontogenic differentiation. The enhancement of these cellular processes was mediated through exosomal CD73-mediated adenosine receptor activation of AKT and ERK signaling. Consistent with these observations, MSC exosomes increased the expression of dentin matrix proteins and promoted the formation of dentin-like tissue and bridge-like structures in a rat pulp defect model. These effects were comparable to that of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) treatment. MSC exosomes also yielded recellularized pulp-dentin tissues in the root canal of endodontically-treated human premolars, following subcutaneous implantation in the mouse dorsum. Together, our findings suggest that MSC exosomes could exert a multi-faceted effect on DPC functions including migration, proliferation and odontogenic differentiation to promote dental pulp regeneration.

Aging could perturb microglial balances, resulting in lowered post-I/R retinal repair. Young bone marrow (BM) stem cell antigen 1-positive (Sca-1+) cells have been demonstrated to have higher reparative capabilities post-I/R retinal injury when transplanted into old mice, where they were able to home and differentiate into retinal microglia. METHODS: Exosomes were enriched from young Sca-1+ or Sca-1- cells, and injected into the vitreous humor of old mice post-retinal I/R. Bioinformatics analyses, including miRNA sequencing, was used to analyze exosome contents, which was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Western blot was then performed to examine expression levels of inflammatory factors and underlying signaling pathway proteins, while immunofluorescence staining was used to examine the extent of pro-inflammatory M1 microglial polarization. Fluoro-Gold labelling was then utilized to identify viable ganglion cells, while H&E staining was used to examine retinal morphology post-I/R and exosome treatment. RESULTS: Sca-1+ exosome-injected mice yielded better visual functional preservation and lowered inflammatory factors, compared to Sca-1-, at days 1, 3, and 7 days post-I/R. miRNA sequencing found that Sca-1+ exosomes had higher miR-150-5p levels, compared to Sca-1- exosomes, which was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Mechanistic analysis found that miR-150-5p from Sca-1+ exosomes repressed the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3)/JNK/c-Jun axis, leading to IL-6 and TNF-α downregulation, and subsequently reduced microglial polarization, all of which contributes to reduced ganglion cell apoptosis and preservation of proper retinal morphology. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates a potential new therapeutic approach for neuroprotection against I/R injury, via delivering miR-150-5p-enriched Sca-1+ exosomes, which targets the miR-150-5p/MEKK3/JNK/c-Jun axis, thereby serving as a cell-free remedy for treating retinal I/R injury and preserving visual functioning.","2023-06-15","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","194","","1","21","","J Nanobiotechnology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37322478 PMCID: PMC10268362","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\3YLBRDZH\Wang et al. - 2023 - Young Sca-1+ bone marrow stem cell-derived exosome.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37322478","","Animals; Bone Marrow Cells; Bone marrow Sca-1+ cell; Exosomes; Ischemia/reperfusion injury; MEKK3; Mice; Microglia; MicroRNAs; miR-150-5p; Reperfusion Injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bone microdamage is mainly caused by processes such as enhancing osteoclast activity or reducing bone formation by osteoblast-lineage cells. Compared with young individuals, extracellular vesicles derived from senescent bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells(BMSCs) increase the transient differentiation of bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) to osteoclasts, ultimately leading to osteoporosis and metal implant failure. To address this daunting problem, an exosome-targeted orthopedic implant composed of a nutrient coating was developed. A high-zinc atmosphere used as a local microenvironmental cue not only could inhibit the bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclasts but also could induce the reprogramming of senile osteogenesis and osteoclast dialogue by exosome modification. Bidirectional regulation of intercellular communication via cargoes, including microRNAs carried by exosomes, was detected. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrated that the key regulator miR-146b-5p regulates the protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway by targeting the catalytic subunit gene of PI3K-PIK3CB. In vivo evaluation using a naturally-aged osteoporotic rat femoral defect model further confirmed that a nutrient coating substantially augments cancellous bone remodeling and osseointegration by regulating local BMMs differentiation. Altogether, this study not only reveals the close link between senescent stem cell communication and age-related osteoporosis but also provides a novel orthopedic implant for elderly patients with exosome modulation capability.","2023-09-23","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","346","","1","21","","J Nanobiotechnology","Dominoes with interlocking consequences triggered by zinc","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37741978 PMCID: PMC10518091","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\CKJ9N4BB\Yin et al. - 2023 - Dominoes with interlocking consequences triggered .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37741978","","Aged; Aging; Animals; Cellular communication; Exosomes; Humans; Mammals; Orthopedic implant; Osteoclasts; Osteogenesis; Rats; Senile osteogenesis; Zinc","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, they are easily eliminated by macrophages and incapable of targeting the osteolysis zone. In this study, based on macrophage ""homing"" into periprosthetic osteolysis region and cell membrane encapsulating nanotechnology, exosomes from urine-derived stem cells were encapsulated with macrophage membrane (MM) to prevent periprosthetic osteolysis. We found that macrophage membrane encapsulated urine-derived stem cell-derived exosomes (MM-Exos) can be targeted delivery to the osteolysis zone and enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of Exos, which alleviated wear particles-induced calvarial osteolysis. Furthermore, MM-Exos could provide immunological camouflage and allow the Exos to avoid phagocytosis by macrophages and stimulate cellular uptake by bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs). Therefore, we demonstrated the unique ability of the macrophage membrane as a targeted transport of exosomes from urine-derived stem cells for the prevention and treatment of periprosthetic osteolysis. These biomimetic nanoparticles provided a new therapeutic exosome delivery system for preventing wear particles-induced osteolysis.

Diabetes is one of the most important factors contributing to periodontitis. Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) have been reported to promote bone regeneration. This study aimed to examine the function and mechanism of exosomes derived from periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs-Exo) in regulating periodontal regeneration in diabetic periodontitis. METHODS: Exosomes derived from normal-glucose-cultured PDLSCs (NG-PDLSCs-Exo) and high-glucose-preconditioned PDLSCs (HG-PDLSCs-Exo) were used. Their effects on RAW264.7 cells were investigated by TRAP staining and quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The role of exosomal miR-31-5p in osteoclast differentiation was tested using qRT-PCR, double luciferase analysis, and Western blotting. We investigated the effects of these two types of PDLSCs-Exo on alveolar bone loss in vivo in mice with experimental periodontitis. RESULTS: PDLSCs-Exo were transferred to RAW264.7, and HG-PDLSCs-Exo inhibited osteoclast formation to a lesser extent than NG-PDLSCs-Exo. Further studies revealed the effect of PDLSCs-Exo on osteoclastogenesis via the miR-31-5p/eNOS signaling pathway. In mice with experimental periodontitis, PDLSCs-Exo reduced alveolar bone destruction and decreased the number of osteoclasts on the alveolar bone surface.

As an essential component of the host immunity, macrophages are highly plastic and play a crucial role in inflammatory response. An appropriate and timely transition from proinflammatory (M1) to anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages is indispensable for treating periodontitis. As M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (M2-exos) can actively target inflammatory sites and modulate immune microenvironments, M2-exos can effectively treat periodontitis. Excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and unfolded protein response (UPR) are highly destructive pathological characteristics during inflammatory periodontal bone loss. Although melatonin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, studies focusing on melatonin ER stress modulation remain limited. This study fabricates engineered M2-exos loading with melatonin (Mel@M2-exos) for treating periodontitis. As a result, M2-exos drive an appropriate and timely macrophage reprogramming from M1 to M2 type, which resolves chronic inflammation and accelerated periodontal healing. Melatonin released from Mel@M2-exos rescues the osteogenic and cementogenic differentiation capacity in inflammatory human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) by reducing excessive ER stress and UPR.

Here, we found that neural stem cells (NSCs) residing in the subventricular zone participated in lipid metabolism homeostasis of regenerative bone through exosomal perilipin 5 (PLIN5). Fluorescence-labeled exosomes tracing and histological detection identified that NSC-derived exosomes (NSC-Exo) could travel from the lateral ventricle into bone injury sites. Homocysteine (Hcy) led to osteogenic and angiogenic impairment, whereas the NSC-Exo were confirmed to restore it. Mecobalamin, a clinically used neurotrophic drug, further enhanced the protective effects of NSC-Exo through increased PLIN5 expression. Mechanistically, NSC-derived PLIN5 reversed excessive Hcy-induced lipid metabolic imbalance and aberrant lipid droplet accumulation through lipophagy-dependent intracellular lipolysis. Intracerebroventricular administration of mecobalamin and/or AAV-shPlin5 confirmed the effects of PLIN5-driven endocrine modulations on new bone formation and vascular reconstruction in hyperhomocysteinemic and high-fat diet models.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEV) have been shown to exert therapeutic effects on bone defects. However, cultured MSCs are typically exposed to normoxia (21% O2) in vitro, which differs largely from the oxygen concentration in vivo under hypoxic conditions. It is largely unknown whether sEV derived from dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) cultured under hypoxic conditions (Hypo-sEV) exert better therapeutic effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory osteolysis than those cultured under normoxic conditions (Nor-sEV) by simultaneously inhibiting the macrophage inflammatory response and osteoclastogenesis. In this study, we show that hypoxia significantly induces the release of sEV from DPSCs. Moreover, Hypo-sEV exhibit significantly improved efficacy in promoting M2 macrophage polarization and suppressing osteoclast formation to alleviate LPS-induced inﬂammatory calvarial bone loss compared with Nor-sEV. Mechanistically, hypoxia preconditioning markedly alters the miRNA profiles of DPSC-sEV. MiR-210-3p is enriched in Hypo-sEV, and can simultaneously induce M2 macrophage generation and inhibit osteoclastogenesis by targeting NF-κB1 p105, which attenuates osteolysis.

Studies have suggested that umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (uMSCs) could promote angiogenesis. This study investigated whether exosomes derived from uMSCs (uMSC-Exos) could enhance fracture healing as primary factors by promoting angiogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: uMSCs were obtained to isolate uMSC-Exos by ultrafiltration, with exosomes from human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) being used as control groups. NanoSight, laser light scattering spectrometer, transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting were used to identify exosomes. Next, uMSC-Exos combined with hydrogel were transplanted into the fracture site in a rat model of femoral fracture. Bone healing processes were monitored and evaluated by radiographic methods on days 7, 14, 21 and 31 after surgery; angiogenesis of the fracture sites was assessed by radiographic and histological strategies on post-operative day 14. In vitro, the expression levels of osteogenesis- or angiogenesis-related genes after being cultured with uMSC-Exos were identified by qRT-PCR. The internalization ability of exosomes was determined using the PKH67 assay. Cell cycle analysis, EdU incorporation and immunofluorescence staining, scratch wound assay and tube formation analysis were also used to determine the altered abilities of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) administered with uMSC-Exos in proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. Finally, to further explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, specific RNA inhibitors or siRNAs were used, and the subsequent effects were observed. RESULTS: uMSC-Exos had a diameter of approximately 100 nm, were spherical, meanwhile expressing CD9, CD63 and CD81. Transplantation of uMSC-Exos markedly enhanced angiogenesis and bone healing processes in a rat model of femoral fracture. In vitro, other than enhancing osteogenic differentiation, uMSC-Exos increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). uMSC-Exos were taken up by HUVECs and enhanced their proliferation, migration and tube formation. Finally, by using specific RNA inhibitors or siRNAs, it has been confirmed that HIF-1α played an important role in the uMSC-Exos-induced VEGF expression, pro-angiogenesis and enhanced fracture repair, which may be one of the underlying mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed a novel role of exosomes in uMSC-mediated therapy and suggested that implanted uMSC-Exos may represent a crucial clinical strategy to accelerate fracture healing via the promotion of angiogenesis. HIF-1α played an important role in this process.","2019-03","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","e12570","","2","52","","Cell Prolif","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30663158 PMCID: PMC6496165","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\RINT8UAQ\Zhang et al. - 2019 - Exosomes from human umbilical cord mesenchymal ste.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30663158","","angiogenesis; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cells, Cultured; exosomes; Exosomes; Femoral Fractures; fracture healing; Fracture Healing; HEK293 Cells; HIF-1α; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Osteogenesis; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Umbilical Cord; umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering the aligned architecture of the tendon, inflammatory microenvironment at the injury site, and the need for endogenous cell/tissue infiltration, there is an imminent need for an ideal scaffold to promote TBH that has aligned architecture, ability to modulate inflammation, and macroporous structure. Herein, a novel macroporous hydrogel comprising sodium alginate/hyaluronic acid/small extracellular vesicles from adipose-derived stem cells (sEVs) (MHA-sEVs) with aligned architecture and immunomodulatory ability is fabricated. When implanted subcutaneously, MHA-sEVs significantly improve cell infiltration and tissue integration through its macroporous structure. When applied to the osteoporotic RCR model, MHA-sEVs promote TBH by improving tendon repair through macroporous aligned architecture while enhancing bone regeneration by modulating inflammation. Notably, the biomechanical strength of MHA-sEVs is approximately two times higher than the control group, indicating great potential in reducing postoperative retear rates. Further cell-hydrogel interaction studies reveal that the alignment of microfiber gels in MHA-sEVs induces tenogenic differentiation of tendon-derived stem cells, while sEVs improve mitochondrial dysfunction in M1 macrophages (Mφ) and inhibit Mφ polarization toward M1 via nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κb) signaling pathway.

Magnesium (Mg) ion released from bioceramics was reported to facilitate bone regeneration via enhancing osteogenesis and alleviating senescence. In this study, Akermanite biocreamics (Akt) containing Mg ion as a model was demonstrated to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis effects of O-BMSCs by activating the MAPK signaling pathway in vitro.

Furthermore, the in vivo study confirmed that 3D-printed porous Mg-containing Akt scaffolds effectively increased bone regeneration in cranial defects of aged rats. The current results indicated that the exosomal-miR-196a-5p/Hoxa7/MAPK signaling axis might be the potential mechanism underlying Akt-mediated osteogenesis. The exosome-meditaed therapy stimulated by the released Mg ion contained in Akt biocreamics or other biomaterials might serve as a candidate strategy for bone repair in aged individuals.","2024-03","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","14-29","","","33","","Bioact Mater","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38024235 PMCID: PMC10661166","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\W2R9FKAM\Qi et al. - 2024 - Magnesium-containing bioceramics stimulate exosoma.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38024235","","Akermanite; Exosomal miR-196a-5p; Hoxa7/MAPK axis; Magnesium; Senescent osteogenesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interaction between muscle and skeleton exerts pivotal roles in bone remodeling. This study aimed to explore the function of myoblast-derived exosomal Prrx2 in osteogenic differentiation and its potential mechanisms. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from myogenic differentiated C2C12 cells. qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to determine target molecule expression. Osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was evaluated by Alizarin red staining, ALP activity and levels of OCN, OPN, RUNX2, and BMP2. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, RIP, and ChIP assays were performed to verify the interaction between molecules. The nuclear translocation of YAP1 was observed by immunofluorescence staining. In vivo osteoporotic model was established by ovariectomy in mice. Bone loss was examined using HE staining. RESULTS: Prrx2 expression was elevated in myogenic differentiated C2C12 cells and their exosomes. Myoblast-derived exosomal Prrx2 enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Delivering exosomal Prrx2 directly bond to MIR22HG promoter and promoted its transcription and expression. MIR22HG enhanced expression and nuclear translocation of YAP via sponging miR-128, thus facilitating BMSC osteogenic differentiation. Knockdown of exosomal Prrx2 suppressed osteogenic differentiation, which could be abolished by MIR22HG overexpression. Similarly, miR-128 inhibitor or YAP overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of MIR22HG depletion or miR-128 mimics on osteogenic differentiation. Finally, myoblast-derived exosomal Prrx2 alleviated osteoporosis in mice via up-regulating MIR22HG and activating the Hippo pathway. CONCLUSION: Myoblast-derived exosomal Prrx2 contributes to transcriptional activation of MIR22HG to activate YAP pathway via sponging miR-128, thereby facilitating osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.","2023-04-20","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","54","","1","29","","Mol Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37081396 PMCID: PMC10116833","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\FIY2EX2U\Li et al. - 2023 - Myoblast-derived exosomal Prrx2 attenuates osteopo.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37081396","","Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Female; Hippo Signaling Pathway; Mice; MicroRNAs; MIR22HG; Myoblasts; Osteogenesis; Osteogenic differentiation; Osteoporosis; Prrx2; RNA, Long Noncoding; Sarcopenia; YAP signaling pathway","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinically, growth factors such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) are used to enhance/hasten this process to heal critical sized defects. However, the clinical application of such growth factors is fraught with dosage challenges as well as immunological and ectopic complications. The identification of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as active components of the MSC secretome suggest alternative approaches to enhancing bone regeneration. Based on our earlier studies on the properties of EVs from lineage specified MSCs, this study sought to engineer EVs to enhance osteogenic differentiation. To generate MSC EVs with enhanced osteoinductive abilities, genetically modified human bone marrow derived MSCs (HMSCs) were generated by constitutively expressing BMP2. We hypothesized that these cells would generate functionally engineered EVs (FEEs) with enhanced osteoinductive properties. Our results show that these FEEs maintained the general physical and biochemical characteristics of naïve HMSC EVs in the form of size distribution, EV marker expression and endocytic properties but show increased bone regenerative potential compared to MSC EVs in a rat calvarial defect model in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that although BMP2 was constitutively expressed in the parental cells, the corresponding EVs (FEEs) do not contain BMP2 protein as an EV constituent. Further investigations revealed that the FEEs potentiate the BMP2 signaling cascade possibly due to an altered miRNA composition. Collectively, these studies indicate that EVs' functionality may be engineered by genetic modification of the parental MSCs to induce osteoinduction and bone regeneration. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: With mounting evidence for the potential of MSC EVs in treatment of diseases and regeneration of tissues, it is imperative to evaluate if they can be modified for application specificity. The results presented here indicate the possibility for generating Functionally Engineered EVs (FEEs) from MSC sources. As a proof of concept approach, we have shown that EVs derived from genetically modified MSCs (BMP2 overexpression) can be effective as biomimetic substitutes for growth factors for enhanced tissue-specific regeneration (bone regeneration) in vivo. Mechanistic studies highlight the role of EV miRNAs in inducing pathway-specific changes. We believe that this study will be useful to researchers evaluating EVs for regenerative medicine applications.","2020-06","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","182-194","","","109","","Acta Biomater","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32305445 PMCID: PMC8040700","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\HJ62SHUG\Huang et al. - 2020 - Functionally engineered extracellular vesicles imp.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32305445","","Animals; BMP2; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; Bone regeneration; Bone Regeneration; Cell Differentiation; Cell Engineering; Endocytosis; Exosomes; Extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; Mesenchymal stem cells; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Osteogenesis; Rats; Signal Transduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we employed collagenase-released EVs (CREVs) containing abundant MtVs from mouse osteoblasts. CREVs were administered locally in gelatin hydrogels to damaged sites after a femoral bone defect in mice. CREVs exhibited the characteristics of MtVs with a diameter <200 nm. The local administration of CREVs significantly promoted the formation of new bone with increases in the number of alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-positive cells and cartilage formation at the damaged site after the femoral bone defect. However, the addition of CREVs to the medium did not promote the osteogenic differentiation of ST2 cells or the ALP activity or mineralization of mouse osteoblasts in vitro. In conclusion, we herein showed for the first time that MtVs enhanced bone repair after a femoral bone defect partly through osteogenesis and chondrogenesis in mice.

However, the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the biogenesis and function of exosomes and its effects on bone regeneration remains elusive. In this study, we used H2S slow releasing donor GYY4137 to stimulate macrophages and found that H2S promoted the polarization of M2 macrophages to increase bone regeneration of MSCs in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we developed the H2S pre-treated M2 macrophage exosomes and found these exosomes displayed significantly higher capacity to promote bone regeneration in calvarial bone defects by re-establishing the local immune microenvironment. Mechanically, H2S treatment altered the protein profile of exosomes derived from M2 macrophages. One of the significantly enriched exosomal proteins stimulated by H2S, moesin protein, facilitated the exosomes endocytosis into MSCs, leading to activated the β-catenin signaling pathway to promote osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. In summary, H2S pretreated M2 exosomes promoted the bone regeneration of MSCs via facilitating exosomes uptake by MSCs and activate β-catenin signaling pathway.

Cell-free therapy based on stem cell exosomes is a safer and more promising approach for tissue regeneration. Here, we investigated the effect of exosomes from human urine-derived stem cells (USCs) and their subpopulations (CD133+USCs) on RC healing. METHODS: USCs were isolated from urine and sorted by flow cytometry to obtain CD133+ urine-derived stem cells (CD133+ USCs). Urine-derived stem cell exosomes (USC-Exos) and CD133+ urine-derived stem cell exosomes (CD133+ USC-Exos) were subsequently isolated from the cell supernatant and identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), particle size analysis, and Western blot. We performed in vitro functional assays to evaluate the effects of USC-Exos and CD133+ USC-Exos on human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) proliferation, migration, osteogenic differentiation, and chondrogenic differentiation. In vivo experiments were performed by local injection of exosome-hydrogel complexes for the treatment of RC injury. The effects of CD133+ USC-Exos and USC-Exos on RC healing were assessed from imaging, histological, and biomechanical tests. RESULTS: CD133+ USCs were positive for CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD133, but negative for CD34 and CD45. Differentiation ability test results showed that both USCs and CD133+ USCs had the potential for osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation, but CD133+ USCs had stronger chondrogenic differentiation ability. CD133+ USC-Exos and USC-Exos could be efficiently taken up by BMSCs and promote their migration, osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. However, CD133+ USC-Exos could promote the chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs more than USC-Exos. Compared with USC-Exos, CD133+ USC-Exos could promote the healing of bone-tendon interface (BTI) more effectively, which might be related to its ability to promote the differentiation of BMSCs into chondroblasts. Although the two exosomes exhibited the same effect in promoting subchondral bone repair in BTI, the CD133+ USC-Exos group had higher histological scores and stronger biomechanical properties. CONCLUSION: CD133+ USC-Exos hydrogel complex may become a promising therapeutic approach for RC healing based on stem cell exosomes. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: This is the first study to assess the specific role of CD133+ USC-Exos in RC healing which may be related to the activation of BMSCs by CD133+ USC-Exos towards chondrogenic differentiation.

In this study, we hypothesized that mesenchymal stem cell derived extracellular vesicle functionality can be rendered pathway-specific using a miRNA-based extracellular vesicles engineering approach. To test this hypothesis, we utilized bone repair as a model system and the BMP2 signaling cascade as the targeted pathway. We engineered mesenchymal stem cell extracellular vesicles to possess increased levels of miR-424, a potentiator of the BMP2 signaling cascade. We evaluated the physical and functional characteristics of these extracellular vesicles and their enhanced ability to trigger the osteogenic differentiation of naïve mesenchymal stem cell in vitro and facilitate bone repair in vivo. Results indicated that the engineered extracellular vesicles retained their extracellular vesicles characteristics and endocytic functionality and demonstrated enhanced osteoinductive function by activating SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and mesenchymal stem cell differentiation in vitro and enhanced bone repair in vivo.

ABs were isolated from apoptotic bone marrow macrophages, preosteoclasts, and mature osteoclasts induced by staurosporine. Proteomic signature analysis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry suggested marked protein cargo differences among the different ABs. Further bioinformatic analysis showed that the proteomic signatures of the ABs were highly similar to those of their parental cells. Functionally, pOC-ABs induced endothelial progenitor cell differentiation and increased CD31hiEmcnhi endothelial cell formation in a murine bone defect model via their PDGF-BB cargo. mOC-ABs induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and facilitated osteogenesis via RANKL reverse signaling.

We studied two complementary aspects required for exosome activity/therapy using purified exosomes: first, the intracellular uptake of labeled exosomes and second, the influence of delivered exosomes on cell behavior. Origin-specific differences in the characteristics of purified exosomes, quantification of time-dependent intracellular uptake of PKH-26-labeled exosomes by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and preosteoblasts, and influence on cell behavior were evaluated. Furthermore, exosomes from osteoblasts and MSCs cultured under normal and osteogenic environments were isolated. There is little data available on the concentration and dose of exosomes required for bone regeneration. Therefore, equal amounts of quantified exosomes were implanted in vivo in rat tibia critical defects using a calcium sulfate-nano-hydroxyapatite nanocement (NC) bone filler as the carrier. Bone regeneration was quantified using micro-computed tomography and histology. Along with inducing early maturation and mineral deposition by primary preosteoblasts in vitro, exosome treatment also demonstrated a positive effect on bone mineralization in vivo.

Recent studies show that the regulation of osteoblasts (OBs) by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) is an important mechanism in alleviating DBD and that exosomes are recognized as the key medium. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosome (MSC-Exos) therapy is a promising approach to facilitate tissue repair. However, the influence of exosomes from diabetic conditioned BMSCs on OBs and bone regeneration, as well as the underlying mechanism, are still elusive. Here, we used high-glucose medium to mimic diabetic conditions and normal-glucose medium as control to mimic nondiabetic conditions in vitro and found that microRNA-17 (miR-17) was downregulated in diabetic-conditioned BMSC-derived exosomes (HG-Exos), HG-Exo-co-cultured osteoblasts, and the skull of rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Further experiment concluded that nondiabetic conditioned BMSC-Exos (NG-Exos) promoted the osteogenesis of OBs and bone regeneration of rats with T2DM via upregulation of miR-17. Compare with NG-Exos, HG-Exos impeded osteogenesis of OBs in vitro and bone regeneration of rats in vivo by downregulation of miR-17. Moreover, miR-17 promoted bone regeneration by targeting SMAD7, which was further proved to have a negative effect on osteogenesis. Taken together, nondiabetic BMSC-derived exosomes greatly foster bone regeneration, whereas diabetic BMSC-derived exosomes undermine the promotion effect of MSC-Exos by regulating the miR-17/SMAD7 axis. These findings provide support for the miR-17-5p/SMAD7 axis as a promising therapeutic target to treat DBD.","2023-12","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","111190","","Pt B","125","","Int Immunopharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37976598","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37976598","","Animals; Bone Regeneration; Diabetes mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic bone disease; Exosomes; Glucose; microRNA; MicroRNAs; Osteogenesis; Rats; SMAD7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to investigate whether MSC-Exos cultured on scaffolds of different dimensions could improve the poor joint cavity microenvironment caused by cartilage injury and to explore the related mechanisms.

In short-term animal experiments, compared with exosomes derived from MSCs cultured in a two-dimensional (2D) environment (2D-Exos), 3D-Exos had a stronger ability to regulate the joint cavity microenvironment. Long-term animal studies confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of 3D-Exos over 2D-Exos. Thus, 3D-Exos were applied in the rat knee osteochondral defect model after adsorption in the micropores of the scaffold and combined with subsequent articular cavity injections, and they showed a stronger cartilage repair ability.

First, purified human perivascular stem cells (PSCs) were observed to induce mitogenic, pro-migratory, and pro-osteogenic effects on osteoprogenitor cells while in non-contact co-culture via elaboration of EVs. PSC-derived EVs shared mitogenic, pro-migratory, and pro-osteogenic properties of their parent cell. PSC-EV effects were dependent on surface-associated tetraspanins, as demonstrated by EV trypsinization, or neutralizing antibodies for CD9 or CD81. Moreover, shRNA knockdown in recipient cells demonstrated requirement for the CD9/CD81 binding partners IGSF8 and PTGFRN for EV bioactivity. Finally, PSC-EVs stimulated bone repair, and did so via stimulation of skeletal cell proliferation, migration, and osteodifferentiation.

In this regard, the MSC's immunomodulatory properties in tissue repair are well documented. The paracrine effects of MSCs in immunomodulation are, in part, attributable to their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs). When MSCs migrate to the wound bed, they are exposed to a myriad of inflammatory signals. To understand their response to an inflammatory environment from an EV perspective, we sought to evaluate the effects of the inflammatory cytokine TNFα on MSC EV mediated immunomodulation. Our results indicate that while the physical characteristics of the EVs remain unchanged, the TNFα preconditioned MSC EVs possess enhanced immunomodulatory properties. In vitro experiments using polarized (M1 and M2) primary mouse macrophages indicated that the preconditioned MSC EVs suppressed pro-inflammatory (M1) markers such as IL-1β and iNOS and elevated reparatory (M2) markers such as Arg1 and CD206. When evaluated in vivo in a rat calvarial defect model, the TNFα preconditioned MSC EVs reduced inflammation at 1-, 3- and 7-days post wounding resulting in the subsequent enhanced bone formation at 4- and 8-weeks post wounding possibly by modulation of oncostatin M (OSM) expression. An analysis of EV miRNA composition revealed significant changes to anti-inflammatory miRNAs in the preconditioned MSC EVs hinting at a possible role for EV derived miRNA in the enhanced immunomodulatory activity. Overall, these results indicate that MSC exposure to inflammatory signals influence the MSC EV's immunomodulatory function in the context of tissue repair. The specific function of TNFα preconditioned MSC EV miRNAs in immunomodulatory control of bone regeneration merits further investigation.","2022","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","878194","","","13","","Front Immunol","Extracellular Vesicles From TNFα Preconditioned MSCs","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35585987 PMCID: PMC9108364","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35585987","","Animals; bone regeneration; Bone Regeneration; extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; immunomodulation; Immunomodulation; mesenchymal stem cells; Mice; MicroRNAs; Rats; TNFα; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) were treated with GMSC-Exo or Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived lipopolysaccharide (P.g-LPS) in vitro. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot were carried out to detect the expressions of osteogenic differentiation-related factors in cells. Further, PDLSCs were treated with P.g-LPS or inhibitors. The expression of NF-κB pathway-related factors as well as of Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related factors were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. RESULTS: GMSC-Exo treatment promoted the expression of osteogenic differentiation-related factors within PDLSCs in both normal and inflammatory environments. Further investigations showed that GMSC-Exo could also inhibit the P.g-LPS-induced activation of the NF-κB pathway, leading to the up-regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. When the Wnt/β-catenin signalling was blocked, the inhibitory effect of GMSC-Exo on the NF-κB pathway was abolished. CONCLUSIONS: GMSC-Exo could promote the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. There could be mutually exclusive regulatory roles between the NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways in a periodontal inflammatory environment.

The use of biomimetic scaffolds for bone tissue engineering has been investigated for decades. To date, the trend in this area has been moved toward the construction of biomimetic acellular scaffolds with effective modification to enhance the osteogenic differentiation efficiency of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The exosomes derived from BMSCs have been shown as a potential therapeutic tool for repairing bone defects. In this study, we demonstrated the pro-osteogenic effects of exosomes derived form osteogenic differentiated BMSCs (OBMSC) and presented a novel exosmes-functionalized decellularized fish scale (DE-FS) scaffold for promoting bone regeneration in vivo. The DE-FS scaffolds were obtained through decellularization and decalcification processes, which exhibited high biocompatibility and low immunological rejection. The intrinsic anisotropic structures of DE-FS could enhance the adhesion and proliferation ability of BMSCs in vitro. In addition, we demonstrated that the porous structure of DE-FS endowed them with the capacity to load and release exosomes to BMSCs, resulting in the enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Concerning these pro-osteogenic effects, it was further proved that OBMSC exosome-modified DE-FS scaffolds could effectively promote bone regeneration in the mouse calvarial defect models.

The modulatory effects of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) on macrophages have encouraged the functionalization of scaffolds through the integration of the exosomes from the BMP2-stimulated macrophages to avoid ectopic bone formation and reduce adverse effects. To determine the functionality of exosomal nanocarriers from macrophages after BMP2 stimulation, we isolated the exosomes from Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)- or BMP2-stimulated macrophages and evaluated their effects on osteogenesis. Morphological characterization of the exosomes derived from DMEM- or BMP2-treated macrophages revealed no significant differences, and the bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells showed similar cellular uptake patterns for both exosomes. In vitro study using BMP2/macrophage-derived exosomes indicated their beneficial effects on osteogenic differentiation. To improve the bio-functionality for titanium implants, BMP2/macrophage-derived exosomes were used to modify titanium nanotube implants to favor osteogenesis. The incorporation of BMP2/macrophage-derived exosomes dramatically increased the expression of early osteoblastic differentiation markers, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and BMP2, indicative of the pro-osteogenic role of the titanium nanotubes incorporated with BMP2/macrophage-derived exosomes. The titanium nanotubes functionalized with BMP2/macrophage-derived exosomes activated autophagy during osteogenic differentiation. In conclusion, the exosome-integrated titanium nanotube may serve as an emerging functional material for bone regeneration.

As nanoscale natural particles, exosomes or small extracellular vesicles (EVs) of MSCs have potential to circumvent these problems. It is significant to investigate the impact of the tissue origin of MSCs on the therapeutic bioactivity of their corresponding EVs for cartilage and bone regeneration. Here, rat MSCs isolated from the adipose, bone marrow, and synovium are cultured to obtain their corresponding EVs (ADSC-EVs, BMSC-EVs, and SMSC-EVs, respectively). The ADSC-EVs stimulate the migration, proliferation, and chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro as well as cartilage and bone regeneration in a mouse model more than the BMSC-EVs or SMSC-EVs. Proteomics analysis reveals that the tissue origin contributes to the distinct protein profiles among the three types of EVs, which induced cartilage and bone regenerative capacities by potential mechanisms of regulating signaling pathways including focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, actin cytoskeleton, cAMP, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Consequently, these findings provide insight that the adipose may be a superior candidate in EV-based nanomedicine for cartilage and bone regeneration.

We confirmed that LncRNA-MALAT1 directly binds to miR-124 to negatively control miR-124 activity. Moreover, overexpression of miR-124 could reverse the migration and osteoclastic differentiation of BMMs induced by EPC-derived exosomes. A dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that the integrin ITGB1 is the target of miR-124.

The collected EMs had a significantly increased proportion of vesicles positive for the exosome-specific CD-63 marker compared with MSC-derived exosomes. EMs were further obtained from genetically modified hMSCs in which expression of noggin, a natural bone morphogenetic protein antagonist, was down-regulated to enhance osteogenic properties of EMs. Moreover, the administration of hMSC-EMs in conjunction with an injectable chitosan hydrogel into mouse nonhealing calvarial defects demonstrated robust bone regeneration.

Macrophages play an important role in the immune response to inflammation. Therefore, this study adopts TIM3 high expression extracellular vesicles (EVs) with immunosuppressive function to reshape the early immune microenvironment of bone injury, mainly by targeting macrophages. These EVs can be phagocytosed by macrophages, thereby increasing the infiltration of TIM3-positive macrophages (TIM3+ macrophages) and M2 subtypes. The TIM3+ macrophage group has some characteristics of M2 macrophages and secretes cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-β1 to regulate inflammation. TIM3, which is highly expressed in the engineered EVs, mediates the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the p38/MAPK pathway and promotes osseointegration by activating the Bmp2 promoter to enhance macrophage BMP2 secretion. After evenly loading the engineered EVs into the hydrogel, the continuous and slow release of EVsTIM3OE recruits more anti-inflammatory macrophages during the early stages of bone defect repair, regulating the immune microenvironment and eliminating the adverse effects of excessive inflammation. In summary, this study provides a new strategy for the treatment of refractory wounds through early inflammation control.","2023-12-06","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","e2303681","","","","","Adv Healthc Mater","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38054523","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38054523","","bone regeneration; extracellular vesicles; immunoregulation; macrophages; TIM3 protein","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from the secretome of human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated to modulate inflammation and reduce fibrotic adhesions, and therefore their local application could improve outcomes after RC repair. PURPOSE: In this pilot study, we evaluated the efficacy of clinical-grade human umbilical cord (hUC) MSC-derived sEVs (hUC-MSC-sEVs) loaded onto a type 1 collagen scaffold in an ovine model of acute infraspinatus tendon injury to improve RC healing. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: sEVs were enriched from hUC-MSC culture media and were characterized by surface marker profiling. The immunomodulatory capacity was evaluated in vitro by T-cell proliferation assays, and particle count was determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Twelve skeletally mature sheep were subjected to partial infraspinatus tenotomy and enthesis debridement. The defects of 6 animals were treated with 2 × 1010 hUC-MSC-sEVs loaded onto a type 1 collagen sponge, whereas 6 animals received only a collagen sponge, serving as controls. Six weeks postoperatively, the healing of the infraspinatus tendon and the enthesis was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and hard tissue histology. RESULTS: CD3/CD28-stimulated T-cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by hUC-MSC-sEVs (P = .015) that displayed the typical surface marker profile, including the presence of the MSC marker proteins CD44 and melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. The local application of hUC-MSC-sEVs did not result in any marked systemic adverse events. Histologically, significantly improved Watkins scores (P = .031) indicated improved tendon and tendon-to-bone insertion repair after sEV treatment and lower postcontrast signal of the tendon and adjacent structures on MRI suggested less residual inflammation at the defect area. Furthermore, the formation of osteophytes at the injury site was significantly attenuated (P = .037). CONCLUSION: A local, single-dose application of hUC-MSC-sEVs promoted tendon and enthesis healing in an ovine model of acute RC injury. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Surgical repair of RC tears generally results in a clinical benefit for the patient; however, considerable rerupture rates have been reported. sEVs have potential as a cell-free biotherapeutic to improve healing outcomes after RC injury.","2023-02","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","331-342","","2","51","","Am J Sports Med","Evaluation of the Potential of Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stromal Cell-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles to Improve Rotator Cuff Healing","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36645050","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36645050","","Animals; Collagen Type I; exosomes; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Pilot Projects; rotator cuff; Rotator Cuff; Rotator Cuff Injuries; secretome; Sheep; small extracellular vesicles; tendinopathy; tendon; Umbilical Cord","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mature RBCs, which have no nuclei or genetic material, are easy to obtain, showing high biological safety as a source of extracellular vesicles (EVs).

In this study, we isolated and characterized RBC-derived apoVs (RBC-apoVs) from human venous blood and investigated their role in the osteogenesis of human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). We showed that RBCs could produce RBC-apoVs that expressed both general apoVs markers and RBC markers.

Recent studies have explored the possibility of functional modification of scaffolds in bone tissue engineering. We prepared an SF-CS-nHA (SCN) biomimetic bone scaffold and functionally modified the scaffold material by adding a polydopamine (PDA) coating loaded with exosomes (Exos) of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The effects of the functional composite scaffold (SCN/PDA-Exo) on BMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were investigated. Furthermore, the SCN/PDA-Exo scaffolds were implanted into animals to evaluate their effect on bone regeneration. METHODS: SCN biomimetic scaffolds were prepared by a vacuum freeze-drying/chemical crosslinking method. A PDA-functionalized coating loaded with BMSC-Exos was added by the surface coating method. The physical and chemical properties of the functional composite scaffolds were detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy spectrum analysis and contact angle tests. In vitro, BMSCs were inoculated on different scaffolds, and the Exo internalization by BMSCs was detected by confocal microscopy. The BMSC proliferation activity and cell morphology were detected by SEM, CCK-8 assays and phalloidin staining. BMSC osteogenic differentiation was detected by immunofluorescence, alizarin red staining and qRT‒PCR. In vivo, the functional composite scaffold was implanted into a rabbit critical radial defect model. Bone repair was detected by 3D-CT scanning. HE staining, Masson staining, and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate bone regeneration. RESULTS: Compared with the SCN scaffold, the SCN/PDA-Exo-functionalized composite scaffold had a larger average surface roughness and stronger hydrophilicity. In vitro, the Exos immobilized on the SCN/PDA-Exo scaffolds were internalized by BMSCs. The BMSC morphology, proliferation ability and osteogenic differentiation effect in the SCN/PDA-Exo group were significantly better than those in the other control groups (p < 0.05). The effects of the SCN/PDA-Exo functional composite scaffold on bone defect repair and new bone formation were significantly better than those of the other control groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that the SCN/PDA-Exo-functionalized composite scaffold promoted BMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in vitro and improved bone regeneration efficiency in vivo. Therefore, combining Exos with biomimetic bone scaffolds by functional PDA coatings may be an effective strategy for functionally modifying biological scaffolds.","2023-06","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","25-36","","","23","","Regen Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37063095 PMCID: PMC10091039","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37063095","","Bionic scaffold; Bone regeneration; Exosomes; Osteogenic differentiation; Polydopamine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can regulate bone metabolism and stimulate the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. This study has designed a functionalized bone regeneration scaffold (3D H-P-sEVs) by combining the biological activity of BMSCs-sEVs and the 3D-HA scaffold to improve bone regeneration. The scaffold utilizes the targeting of fusion peptides to increase the loading efficiency of sEVs. The composition, structure, mechanical properties, and in vitro degradation performance of the 3D H-P-sEVs scaffolds were examined. The composite scaffold demonstrated good biocompatibility, substantially increased the expression of osteogenic-related genes and proteins, and had a satisfactory bone integration effect in the critical skull defect model of rats.

Here, we evaluated intracellular communication through small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) and its effects on endogenous bone regeneration mediated by biomimetic intrafibrillarly mineralized collagen (IMC). After implantation in the bone defect area, IMC generated more neobone and recruited more mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) than did extrafibrillarly mineralized collagen (EMC). More CD63+CD90+ and CD63+CD163+ cells were detected in the defect area in the IMC group than in the EMC group. To determine the functional roles of sEVs, extracellular vesicles from macrophages cultured on different mineralized collagen were isolated, and they showed no morphological differences. However, macrophage-derived sEVs in the IMC group showed an enhanced Young's modulus and exerted beneficial effects on the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow MSCs by increasing the expression of the osteoblastic differentiation markers BMP2, BGLAP, COL1, and OSX and calcium nodule formation. Mechanistically, sEVs from IMC-treated macrophages facilitated MSC osteogenesis through the BMP2/Smad5 pathway, and blocking sEV secretion with GW4869 significantly impaired MSC proliferative, immunomodulative and osteogenic potential. Taken together, these findings show that macrophage-derived sEVs may serve as an emerging functional tool in biomaterial-mediated endogenous bone regeneration.","2020-11-30","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","33","","1","12","","Int J Oral Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33257654 PMCID: PMC7705747","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257654","","Biomimetics; Bone Regeneration; Cell Differentiation; Collagen; Extracellular Vesicles; Macrophages; Osteogenesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Calcium and inorganic phosphate (Pi) taken up by MVs form hydroxyapatite crystals, which propagate on collagen fibrils to mineralize the extracellular matrix. Insufficient calcium or phosphate impairs skeletal mineralization. Because active vitamin D is necessary for intestinal calcium absorption, vitamin D deficiency is a significant cause of rickets/osteomalacia. Chronic hypophosphatemia also results in rickets/osteomalacia. Excessive action of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a key regulator of Pi metabolism, leads to renal Pi wasting and impairs vitamin D activation. X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) is the most common form of hereditary FGF23-related hypophosphatemia, and enhanced FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling in osteocytes may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Increased extracellular Pi triggers signal transduction via FGFR to regulate gene expression, implying a close relationship between Pi metabolism and FGFR. An anti-FGF23 antibody, burosumab, has recently been developed as a new treatment for XLH. In addition to various forms of rickets/osteomalacia, hypophosphatasia (HPP) is characterized by impaired skeletal mineralization. HPP is caused by inactivating mutations in tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme rich in MVs. The recent development of enzyme replacement therapy using bone-targeting recombinant alkaline phosphatase has improved the prognosis, motor function, and quality of life in patients with HPP. This links impaired skeletal mineralization with various conditions, and unraveling its pathogenesis will lead to more precise diagnoses and effective treatments.","2019-12","2024-01-26 18:45:05","2024-01-26 18:45:05","","213-219","","4","24","","Ann Pediatr Endocrinol Metab","Skeletal mineralization","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31905439 PMCID: PMC6944863","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31905439","","Hypophosphatasia; Phosphate; Rickets; Skeletal mineralization; Vitamin D","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Next-generation sequencing was utilized to identify the differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) between OVX-Exo and Sham-Exo, while target genes were analyzed using bioinformatics. The regulatory effects of miR-27a-3p and miR-196b-5p on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and osteoclast differentiation were verified by gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses. RESULTS: Osteoclast differentiation was significantly enhanced in the OVX-Exo treatment group compared to the Sham-Exo group.

PDLSC-derived extracellular vesicles (P-EVs) have shown great potential for bone regeneration. However, the secretion and uptake mechanisms of P-EVs remain elusive. Herein, the biogenesis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from PDLSCs was observed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. PDLSCs were transduced with Ras-associated protein 27a (Rab27a) siRNA (PDLSCsiRab27a) to inhibit EV secretion. The effect of P-EVs on BMMSCs was evaluated using a non-contact transwell co-culture system. We observed that Rab27a knockdown decreased EV secretion, and PDLSCsiRab27a remarkably attenuated co-culture-enhanced osteogenesis of BMMSCs. Isolated PDLSC-derived EVs enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs in vitro and induced bone regeneration in a calvarial defect model in vivo. PDLSC-derived EVs were rapidly endocytosed by BMMSCs via the lipid raft/cholesterol endocytosis pathway and triggered the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. In conclusion, PDLSCs contribute to the osteogenesis of BMMSCs through Rab27a-mediated EV secretion, thereby providing a potential cell-free approach for bone regeneration.","2023-05-25","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","8479","","1","13","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37231020 PMCID: PMC10213006","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\HPB932YN\Lu et al. - 2023 - Rab27a-mediated extracellular vesicle secretion co.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37231020","","Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Communication; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; Osteogenesis; Periodontal Ligament; Stem Cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, we added SC-derived exosomes to bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) cultures and observed their effect on BMSCs in vitro; then, we combined exosomes with porous Ti6Al4V scaffolds and observed their effects on bone regeneration and repair in vivo. We found that SC-derived exosomes could promote the migration, proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs and that combining exosomes with porous titanium alloy can effectively improve the efficacy of titanium alloy scaffolds in bone repair. The combination of exosomes and porous Ti6Al4V implants may constitute a new therapeutic strategy for treating bone defects.","2020-10-22","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","559-565","","4","531","","Biochem Biophys Res Commun","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32811642","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32811642","","Alloys; Animals; Bone regeneration; Bone Regeneration; Cell Differentiation; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Exosomes; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Osteogenesis; Porosity; Porous Ti6Al4V Scaffolds; Prostheses and Implants; Rabbits; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Schwann cell; Schwann Cells; Tissue Scaffolds; Titanium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enhancing osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs is a feasible therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis. Here, bone marrow stromal cell (ST)-derived exosomes (STExos) are found to remarkably enhance osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. However, intravenous injection of STExos is inefficient in ameliorating osteoporotic phenotypes in an ovariectomy (OVX)-induced postmenopausal osteoporosis mouse model, which may be because STExos are predominantly accumulated in the liver and lungs, but not in bone. Hereby, the STExo surface is conjugated with a BMSC-specific aptamer, which delivers STExos into BMSCs within bone marrow. Intravenous injection of the STExo-Aptamer complex enhances bone mass in OVX mice and accelerates bone healing in a femur fracture mouse model. These results demonstrate the efficiency of BMSC-specific aptamer-functionalized STExos in targeting bone to promote bone regeneration, providing a novel promising approach for the treatment of osteoporosis and fracture.","2019-11-21","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","20884-20892","","43","11","","Nanoscale","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31660556","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660556","","Animals; Aptamers, Nucleotide; Bone Density; Bone Marrow Cells; Bone Regeneration; Cell Differentiation; Disease Models, Animal; Exosomes; Femur; Flow Cytometry; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; MicroRNAs; Osteoclasts; Osteoporosis; Tissue Distribution; X-Ray Microtomography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the clinical management of bone diseases, there is a paradigm shift in using local drugs at the injury site; however, the dead space created during the surgical debridement of necrotic bone and soft tissues (periosteum and underlying muscle) leads to ineffective bone formation, thereby leading to secondary complications, and thus calls for better regenerative approaches. In this study, we have utilized an exosome-functionalized doxorubicin-loaded biodegradable nanocement (NC)-based carrier along with a Cissus quadrangularis (CQ) extract-laden antioxidant herbal membrane for simultaneously managing the periosteum as well as bone formation in the tumor resection model of osteosarcoma. We initially evaluated the efficacy of scaffolds for in vitro mineralization and bone formation. To examine the in vivo effectiveness, we developed a human osteosarcoma cell line (Saos-2)-induced tumor xenograft model with a critical-sized bone defect. The findings revealed that doxorubicin released from NC was successful in killing the tumor cells and was present even after 30 days of implantation. Additionally, the incorporation of exosomes aided the bone formation, resulting in around a 2.6-fold increase in the bone volume compared to the empty group as evaluated by micro-CT. The herbal membrane assisted in the development of periosteum and mineralizing bone callous as validated through histological and immunofluorescence analysis. Thus, our findings describe a one-step biomaterial-based cell-free approach to regenerate bone in osteosarcoma and prevent further fracture due to the complete development of periosteum and lost bone.","2023-02-07","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","","","","","","ACS Appl Mater Interfaces","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36749176","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36749176","","bone reconstructive surgery; dead space management; exosomes; herbal membrane; local delivery; periosteum formation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the applications of senolytics are limited due to their potential toxicities. Herein, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have been modified by incorporating bone-targeting peptide, specifically (AspSerSer)6 , to encapsulate galactose-modified Maytansinoids (DM1). These modified vesicles are referred to as (AspSerSer)6 -sEVs/DM1-Gal, and they have been designed to specifically clear the senescent osteocytes in bone tissue. In addition, the elevated activity of lysosomal β-galactosidase in senescent osteocytes, but not normal cells in bone tissue, could break down DM1-Gal to release free DM1 for selective elimination of senescent osteocytes. Mechanically, DM1 could disrupt tubulin polymerization, subsequently inducing senescent osteocytes apoptosis. Further, administration of bone-targeting senolytics to aged mice could alleviate aged-related bone loss without non-obvious toxicity. Overall, this bone-targeting senolytics could act as a novel candidate for specific clearance of senescent osteocytes, ameliorating age-related bone loss, with a promising therapeutic potential for senile osteoporosis.","2023-12-08","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","e2302972","","","","","Adv Healthc Mater","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38063283","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38063283","","bone-targeting delivery; galactose-modified Maytansinoid; senescent osteocytes; senile osteoporosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our previous study constructed an innovative low-temperature 3D-printed silk fibroin/collagen I/nano-hydroxyapatite (SF/COL-I/nHA) composite scaffold with a stable structure and remarkable biocompatibility.

Herein, we found that EC-Exos show more efficient bone targeting than osteoblast-derived exosomes or bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes. We also found that EC-Exos can be internalized by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) to alter their morphology. EC-Exos can inhibit osteoclast activity in vitro and inhibit osteoporosis in an ovariectomized mouse model. Sequencing of exosome miRNA revealed that miR-155 was highly expressed in EC-Exos-treated BMMs. The miR-155 level in EC-Exos was much higher than that in BMMs and ECs, indicating that miR-155 was endogenous cargo of EC-derived vesicles. Blockage of BMMs miR-155 levels reversed the suppression by EC-Exos of osteoclast induction, confirming that exosomal miR-155 may have therapeutic potential against osteoporosis.

PDLSC-derived EVs were extracted by ultracentrifugation. In vitro, PDLSC-derived EVs of 10 μg/mL significantly improved the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells and enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts under a tensile strain of 2000 uε.

The results showed that treatment with PDLSC-derived EVs effectively enhanced OTM and promoted osteogenesis on the tension side, including increasing trabecular bone parameters and promoting the expression of osteogenic-related biomarkers (OCN and OPN). More interestingly, we identified several mechano-sensitive miRNAs enriched in PDLSC-derived EVs by high-throughput miRNA sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that they were related to various osteogenesis-related signaling pathways. Therefore, PDLSC-derived EVs could improve the efficiency of OTM by enhancing tension-induced osteogenesis of osteoblasts.

There is a reduced height of the alveolar bone crest in OVX mice by MEVs treatment, but the alveolar bone parameters are not altered. OVX mice are then submitted to a force-induced bone remodeling model by orthodontic tooth movement (OTM). MEVs-treated mice have markedly less bone remodeling movement, unlike the untreated OVX mice. Also, OVX mice treated with MEVs show an increased number of osteoblasts and osteocytes associated with higher sclerostin expression and reduce osteoclasts in the alveolar bone. Although the treatment with MEVs in OVX mice does not show differences in root structure in OTM, few odontoclasts are observed in the dental roots of OVX-treated mice. Compared to untreated mice, maxillary and systemic RANKL/OPG ratios are reduced in OVX mice treated with MEVs.

In this study, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-derived exosomes were loaded with photothermal material layered black phosphorus (BP) modified poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) thermosensitive hydrogels to explore their effects on bone defect repair. In vitro, it was confirmed that the local high heat of nano-BP irradiated using a near-infrared (NIR) laser could trigger the reversible cascade reaction of hydrogels, and that the mechanical contraction of hydrogels led to the controllable release of a large number of exosomes along with the release of water molecules. Furthermore, in vitro investigations demonstrated that BP hydrogels loaded with BMSC-derived exosomes had favourable biocompatibility and could promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Experiments conducted in vivo confirmed that this system significantly promoted bone regeneration. Therefore, the results of our study indicated that the nanoplatform based on BP thermosensitive hydrogels could provide a new clinical treatment strategy for controlled release and on-demand drug delivery, while the cell-free system composed of BMSC-derived exosomes had great application potential in bone tissue repair with the synergism of BP.","2023-05-24","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","4396-4407","","20","11","","J Mater Chem B","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37158364","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37158364","","Bone and Bones; Exosomes; Hydrogels; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Osteogenesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

B","","2050-7518","10.1039/d0tb00422g","","A demineralized bone matrix (DBM) scaffold has good biocompatibility, low antigenicity, a natural porous structure and no cytotoxicity, and so it is an appropriate material for bone regeneration. However, osteoinductive growth factors are often removed during preparation, which destroys the osteoinductive capacity of the DBM scaffold. Biomaterials combined with gene therapy is a promising approach to effectively avoid this adverse side effect. This study develops a human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (hBMP2) gene-activated DBM scaffold to enhance the osteoinductive capacity of DBM and improve bone repair. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived microvesicles (MVs) were obtained, and polyethyleneimine (PEI) and human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (hBMP2) plasmids (phBMP2) were sequentially coated on the MVs by layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly to form an MVs-PEI/phBMP2 non-viral gene vector. Finally, the gene-activated scaffold (DBM/MVs-PEI/phBMP2) was prepared by loading MVs-PEI/phBMP2 onto a DBM scaffold. The experimental results show that the MVs-PEI/phBMP2 exhibits higher transfection efficiency and lower cytotoxicity to MSCs when the MVs/PEI weight ratio = 5, and could enhance the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro. Subcutaneous implantation into rats showed that the DBM/MVs-PEI/phBMP2 scaffold could efficiently enhance the deposition of: collagen fibers, osteocalcin, osteopontin and CD34 endogenous proteins. Rabbit femoral condyle defect experiments proved that the DBM/MVs-PEI/phBMP2 scaffold could significantly promote bone repair. This study presents a novel, highly efficient and low cytotoxicity gene delivery vector based on MVs. The gene-activated DBM scaffold based on MVs not only could promote bone formation but also angiogenesis, implying that this kind of gene-activated scaffold is a promising bone substitute material.","2020-08-05","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","6378-6389","","30","8","","J Mater Chem B","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32633309","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633309","","Animals; Antigens, CD34; Biocompatible Materials; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; Bone Regeneration; Bone Substitutes; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Collagen; Femur; Gene Transfer Techniques; Humans; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Osteocalcin; Osteogenesis; Osteopontin; Plasmids; Polyethyleneimine; Prostheses and Implants; Rabbits; Rats; Tissue Scaffolds; Transfection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current efforts mainly focus on alveolar bone regeneration rather than cementum regeneration, and rarely take Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), the keystone pathogen responsible for periodontal tissue destruction, into consideration. Though M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (M2-EXO) show promise in tissue regeneration, the exosome-producing M2 macrophages are induced by exogenous cytokines with transitory and unstable effects, restricting the regeneration potential of M2-EXO. Here, exosomes derived from genetically engineered M2-like macrophages are constructed by silencing of casein kinase 2 interacting protein-1 (Ckip-1), a versatile player involved in various biological processes. Ckip-1 silencing is proved to be an effective gene regulation strategy to obtain permanent M2-like macrophages with mineralization-promoting effect. Further, exosomes derived from Ckip-1-silenced macrophages (sh-Ckip-1-EXO) rescue Pg-suppressed cementoblast mineralization and cementogenesis. Mechanismly, sh-Ckip-1-EXO delivers Let-7f-5p targeting and silencing Ckip-1, a negative regulator also for cementum formation and cementoblast mineralization. More deeply, downregulation of Ckip-1 in cementoblasts by exosomal Let-7f-5p activates PGC-1α-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis. In all, this study provides a new strategy of genetically engineered M2-like macrophage-derived exosomes for cementum regeneration under Pg-dominated inflammation.","2024-02","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","473-487","","","32","","Bioact Mater","Genetically engineered M2-like macrophage-derived exosomes for P. gingivalis-suppressed cementum regeneration","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37965240 PMCID: PMC10640966","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\H8QA47XX\Huang et al. - 2024 - Genetically engineered M2-like macrophage-derived .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37965240","","Casein kinase 2 interacting protein-1; Cementum regeneration; Exosome; M2 macrophage; Porphyromonas gingivalis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BACKGROUND: Periodontal cells such as PDLCs, OBs and GFs have the potential to enhance bone and periodontal regeneration, but face significant challenges, such as the regulatory and cost implications of in vitro cell culture and storage. To address these challenges, it is important to explore alternative 'cell-free' strategies, such as extracellular vesicles which have emerged as promising tools in regenerative medicine, to facilitate osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Serial centrifuges at 2600 and 16 000 g were used to isolate apoptotic bodies and microvesicles respectively. Small EV-sEV was enriched by our in-house size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The cellular uptake, proliferation, migration and osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation genes were analysed after EVs uptake in BFP-MSCs. RESULTS: Three EV subtypes were enriched and characterised by morphology, particle size and EV-associated protein expression-CD9. Cellular uptake of the three EVs subtypes was observed in BFP-MSCs for up to 7 days. sEV from the three periodontal cells promoted proliferation, migration and osteogenic gene expression. hOBs-sEV showed superior levels of osteogenesis markers compared to that hPDLCs-sEV and hGFs-sEV, while hOBs-16k EV promoted adipogenic gene expression compared to that from hPDLCs and hGFs.

The transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) promotes bone repair and regeneration. However, it has been shown that most BMSCs die within a short period after transplantation. During apoptosis, BMSCs generate a large number of apoptotic cell-derived extracellular vesicles (ApoEVs). This study aims to understand the potential role of ApoEVs in craniofacial bone defect repair and regeneration. First, we confirmed that BMSCs undergo apoptosis within 2 d after transplantation into the defect of the cranium. Abundant ApoEVs were generated from apoptotic BMSCs. Uptake of ApoEVs efficiently promoted the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of recipient BMSCs in vitro. ApoEVs from cells in the middle stage of apoptosis were the most efficient to enhance the regenerative capacity of BMSCs. Moreover, a critical size bone defect model in rats was used to evaluate the osteogenic property of ApoEVs in vivo. Local transplantation of ApoEVs promoted bone regeneration in the calvarial defect. Mechanistically, ApoEVs promoted new bone formation by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species to activate JNK signaling. This study reveals a previously unknown role of the dying transplanted BMSCs in promoting the viability of endogenous BMSCs and repairing the calvarial defects. Since it could avoid several adverse effects and limits of BMSC cytotherapy, treatment of ApoEVs might be a promising strategy in craniofacial bone repair and regeneration.","2022-06","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","714-723","","6","101","","J Dent Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35114838","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35114838","","Animals; apoptosis; Bone Marrow Cells; Bone Regeneration; bone remodeling/regeneration; Cell Differentiation; craniofacial biology; extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; osteogenesis; Osteogenesis; Rats; Reactive Oxygen Species; regenerative medicine; Skull","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current drugs targeted for osteoporosis often have inevitable side effects. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSCs)-derived apoptotic extracellular vesicles (ApoEVs) are nanoscale extracellular vesicles, which has been shown to promote bone regeneration with low immunogenicity and high biological compatibility. However, natural ApoEVs cannot inherently target bones, and are often eliminated by macrophages in the liver and spleen. Thus, our study aimed to reconstruct ApoEVs to enhance their bone-targeting capabilities and bone-promoting function and to provide a new method for osteoporosis treatment. METHODS: We conjugated a bone-targeting peptide, (Asp-Ser-Ser)6 ((DSS)6), onto the surface of ApoEVs using standard carbodiimide chemistry with DSPE-PEG-COOH serving as the linker. The bone-targeting ability of (DSS)6-ApoEVs was determined using an in vivo imaging system and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). We then loaded ubiquitin ligase RING finger protein146 (RNF146) into BMSCs via adenovirus transduction to obtain functional ApoEVs. The bone-promoting abilities of (DSS)6-ApoEVs and (DSS)6-ApoEVsRNF146 were measured in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Our study successfully synthesized bone-targeting and gained functional (DSS)6-ApoEVsRNF146 and found that engineered ApoEVs could promote osteogenesis in vitro and exert significant bone-targeting and osteogenesis-promoting effects to alleviate osteoporosis in a mouse model. CONCLUSION: To promote the bone-targeting ability of natural ApoEVs, we successfully synthesized engineered ApoEVs, (DSS)6-ApoEVsRNF146 and found that they could significantly promote osteogenesis and alleviate osteoporosis compared with natural ApoEVs, which holds great promise for the treatment of osteoporosis.","2024","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","471-488","","","19","","Int J Nanomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38250192 PMCID: PMC10800117","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\AEPFPS4J\Gui et al. - 2024 - Bone-Targeting Peptide and RNF146 Modified Apoptot.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38250192","","Adenoviridae; Animals; apoptotic extracellular vesicles; bone regeneration; bone-targeting; Extracellular Vesicles; mesenchymal stem cells; Mice; Osteogenesis; osteoporosis; Osteoporosis; Peptides","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Extracellular vesicle phenotypes were measured in blinded serum samples from 15 adults with HIV at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after ART initiation. Not all samples were available at each time point so we averaged early (TP1, 1-3 months) and late (TP2, 6-12 months) time points. METHODS: Extracellular vesicles were stained for osteocalcin (OC), RANKL (CD254), RANK (CD265), M-CSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor), and CD34. Serum OC, procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), and C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx) were also measured. RESULTS: BMD significantly decreased from baseline to 12 months. Levels of OC+EVs, serum OC, serum P1NP, and CTx were significantly higher at early and late time points compared with baseline. Increases in EVs expressing OC, RANKL, RANK, and CD34 from baseline to TP1 were associated with decreases in total hip BMD from baseline to 12 months. Change in serum OC, P1NP, and CTx from baseline to TP1 or TP2 did not correlate with change in BMD. CONCLUSION: Early changes in extracellular vesicles expressing markers of bone activity were associated with total hip bone loss 12 months after ART initiation. These data suggest that serum extracellular vesicles may serve as novel biomarkers of bone remodeling. Future studies are required to determine if extracellular vesicles contribute to the effects of ART on changes in bone turnover markers and BMD.","2020-03-01","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","351-361","","3","34","","AIDS","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31725429 PMCID: PMC7983839","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\C42XZG68\Marques de Menezes et al. - 2020 - Serum extracellular vesicles expressing bone activ.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31725429","","Adult; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Biomarkers; Bone Density; Bone Diseases, Metabolic; Bone Remodeling; Extracellular Vesicles; HIV Infections; Humans","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Weak bones due to loss of mineral content along with an increase in the porosity of the femur neck canal in osteoporosis reduce the mechanical properties of the bone and predispose the patients to fractures. In this study, we have used calcium sulfate/nanohydroxyapatite based nanocement (NC) as carrier of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), zoledronate (ZA), and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) derived exosomes (EXO) to enhance bone formation and defect healing in a femur neck canal defect model in osteoporotic rats. A cylindrical defect in the femur neck canal with dimensions of 1 mm (diameter) × 8 mm (length) starting from the lateral cortex toward the apex of the femur head was developed. The defect was impacted using NC alone or functionalized as (a) NC + ZA (systemic), (b) NC + ZA (local), (c) NC + EXO + ZA, and (d) NC + BMP + ZA to evaluate bone formation by ex vivo micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histological analysis 16 weeks postsurgery. Moreover, the femurs (both defect and contralateral leg) were subjected to biomechanical analysis to assess the effect of treatments on compressive mechanical properties of the bones. The treatment groups (NC + ZA (L), NC + BMP + ZA, and NC + EXO + ZA) showed enhanced bone formation with complete healing of the defect. No differences in the mechanical properties of both the defect and contralateral across the leg were observed among the groups. However, a trend was observed where NC + BMP + ZA showed enhanced biomechanical strength in the defect leg. This suggests that NC could act as a potent carrier of bioactive molecules to reduce the risks of hip fractures in osteoporotic animals. This type of treatment can be given to patients who are at higher risk of osteoporosis mediated femur neck fracture as a preventive measure or for enhanced healing in already compromised situations. Moreover, this study provided a proof of concept regarding the use of exosomes in bone regeneration therapy, which might be used as a booster dose that will eventually reduce the dosage of BMP and hence circumvent the limitations associated with the use of BMP.","2020-02-10","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","328-337","","2","21","","Biomacromolecules","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31637919","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637919","","Animals; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; Bone Regeneration; Bone Resorption; Calcium Sulfate; Drug Carriers; Exosomes; Female; Femur Neck; Hip Fractures; Hydroxyapatites; Nanostructures; Osteogenesis; Osteoporosis; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Recombinant Proteins; Transforming Growth Factor beta; X-Ray Microtomography; Zoledronic Acid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Osteoblast differentiation is a sequential event accompanying biogenesis of matrix vesicles and mineralization of collagen matrix with hydroxyapatite crystals. Considerable efforts have been made in developing naturally-occurring plant compounds, preventing bone pathologies, or enhancing bone regeneration. Coumarin aesculetin inhibits osteoporosis through hampering the ruffled border formation of mature osteoclasts. However, little is known regarding the effects of aesculetin on the impairment of matrix vesicle biogenesis. MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in differentiation media with 1-10 μM aesculetin for up to 21 days. Aesculetin boosted the bone morphogenetic protein-2 expression, and alkaline phosphatase activation of differentiating MC3T3-E1 cells. The presence of aesculetin strengthened the expression of collagen type 1 and osteoprotegerin and transcription of Runt-related transcription factor 2 in differentiating osteoblasts for 9 days. When ≥1-5 μM aesculetin was added to differentiating cells for 15-18 days, the induction of non-collagenous proteins of bone sialoprotein II, osteopontin, osteocalcin, and osteonectin was markedly enhanced, facilitating the formation of hydroxyapatite crystals and mineralized collagen matrix. The induction of annexin V and PHOSPHO 1 was further augmented in ≥5 μM aesculetin-treated differentiating osteoblasts for 21 days. In addition, the levels of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase and collagen type 1 were further enhanced within the extracellular space and on matrix vesicles of mature osteoblasts treated with aesculetin, indicating matrix vesicle-mediated bone mineralization. Finally, aesculetin markedly accelerated the production of thrombospondin-1 and tenascin C in mature osteoblasts, leading to their adhesion to preformed collagen matrix. Therefore, aesculetin enhanced osteoblast differentiation, and matrix vesicle biogenesis and mineralization. These findings suggest that aesculetin may be a potential osteo-inductive agent preventing bone pathologies or enhancing bone regeneration.","2021-11-17","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","12391","","22","22","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34830274 PMCID: PMC8621655","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\CU2V3P8J\Na et al. - 2021 - Aesculetin Accelerates Osteoblast Differentiation .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34830274","","aesculetin; Animals; Bone Matrix; Calcification, Physiologic; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; collagen mineralization; Collagen Type I; Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit; Extracellular Vesicles; hydroxyapatite; Integrin-Binding Sialoprotein; matrix vesicles; Mice; non-collagenous proteins; osteoblast differentiation; Osteoblasts; Osteocalcin; Osteogenesis; Osteonectin; Osteopontin; Osteoprotegerin; Signal Transduction; Umbelliferones","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to overcome the disadvantages of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in cell therapy, such as unexpected differentiation leading to tumorization, immune rejection, and other side effects, EVs derived from MSCs (MSC-EVs) with the tissue regenerative function have been studied as new cell-free therapeutics. However, therapeutic applications of EVs require overcoming several challenges. First, the production efficiency of MSC-EVs should be increased at least as much as the quantity of them are required to their clinical application; second, MSC-EVs needs to show various functionality further, thereby increasing tissue regeneration efficiency. In this study, we treated tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a biological derivative known to regulate cholesterol, to MSCs and investigated whether TUDCA treatment would be able to increase EV production efficiency and tissue regenerative capacity of EVs. Indeed, it appears that TUDCA priming to MSC increases the yield of MSC-EVs >2 times by reducing the cellular cholesterol level in MSCs and increasing the exocytosis-related CAV1 expression. Interestingly, it was found that the EVs derived from TUDCA-primed MSCs (T-EV) contained higher amounts of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL1RN, IL6, IL10, and IL11) and osteogenic proteins (ALP, RUNX2, BMP2, BMPR1, and BMPR2) than those in control MSC-EVs (C-EV). Besides, it was shown that T-EV not only regulated M1/M2 macrophages differentiation of monocytes, also effectively increased the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs as well as bone tissue regeneration in a bone defect rat model. Based on these results, it is concluded that TUDCA treatment to MSC as a new approach endows EV with high-yield production and functionality. Thus, we strongly believe T-EV would be a powerful therapeutic material for bone tissue regeneration and potentially could be expanded to other types of tissue regeneration for clinical applications.","2023-02","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","45-56","","","354","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36586671","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36586671","","Animals; Anti-inflammation; Bone regeneration; Bone Regeneration; Cytokines; Extracellular Vesicles; Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs); Osteogenesis; Osteogenic differentiation; Rats; Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, by integrating silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) and M2 macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (M2EVs), a multifunctional DNA-based hydrogel, called Agevgel, is developed with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and osteogenic properties to promote DABD rebuilding. AgNCs are tightly embedded into the DNA scaffolds and exhibit effective anti-bacterial activity, while immunomodulatory M2EVs are encapsulated within the shape-variable DNA scaffolds and exhibit potent anti-inflammatory and osteogenic properties. The results reveal that Agevgel effectively prolongs the local retention time and bioactivity of M2EVs in vivo. In particular, the sustained release of M2EVs can last for at least 7 days when applying Agevgel to DABD. Compared to free M2EVs or Aggel (AgNCs encapsulated within the DNA hydrogel) treatments, the Agevgel treatment accelerates the defect healing rate of alveolar bone and dramatically improves the trabecular architecture. Mechanistically, Agevgel plays a key role in regulating macrophage polarization and promoting the expression of proliferative and osteogenic factors. In summary, Agevgel provides a comprehensive treatment strategy for DABD with a great clinical translational value, highlighting the application of DNA hydrogels as an ideal bioscaffolds for periodontal diseases.","2023-11-02","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","e2305594","","","","","Small","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37919857","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37919857","","anti-bacterial; diabetic periodontal diseases; DNA hydrogel; extracellular vesicles delivery; inflammation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our study aimed to investigate the effect of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) overexpressing glycoprotein non-melanoma clone B (GPNMB) on osteoporosis (OP). MAIN METHODS: Lentiviral vector for GPNMB overexpression or its negative control was generated and transfected into BMSCs. EVs enriched with GPNMB (GPNMB-EVs) were extracted from GPNMB-modified BMSC-conditioned medium and then identified. Cellular uptake and proliferation were analyzed using the Dil-labeled assay and CCK-8 assay, respectively. Cytochemical staining, western blot, and RT-qPCR analysis were performed to assess the effect of GPNMB-EVs on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) as the inhibitor was applied to explore the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway involved in the GPNMB-EV-induced osteogenic differentiation. In vivo experiments were conducted using an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and then assessed the effect of GPNMB-EVs by micro-CT, and histological and immunohistochemical assays. KEY FINDINGS: GPNMB-EVs were taken up by BMSCs, and they noticeably promoted the proliferation of BMSCs. Additionally, GPNMB-EVs activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling to stimulate osteogenesis in BMSCs. In vivo examination showed that GPNMB-EVs remarkably improved trabecular bone regeneration and alleviated the osteoporotic phenotype in the OVX-induced rat model of OP. SIGNIFICANCE: EVs derived from GPNMB-modified BMSCs significantly stimulated the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and attenuated the bone loss in the OVX-induced rat model of OP. Our findings suggest the promising potential of GPNMB-EVs as cell-free therapy for the treatment of OP.","2021-05-01","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","119208","","","272","","Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33582177","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33582177","","Animals; beta Catenin; Bone and Bones; Bone Marrow; Bone Marrow Cells; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Female; Glycoprotein non-melanoma clone B; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mesenchymal stem cells; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; Osteoporosis; Ovariectomy; Rats; Wnt Signaling Pathway","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to clarify the function and mechanism of exosomes containing polylactic acid (PLA), polylactic acid copolymer and BMP-2 in tendon bone healing of rotator cuff tear. First, CD44 expression in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and CD90 and CD44 in exosomes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Then, stability and targeting identification of exosome-delivered bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and PLA microcapsules were measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), DiO/DiI staining. Finally, tendon-bone repair after acute rotator cuff rupture in rabbits was established, and the function of BMP-2 exosomes for tendon bone healing in rotator cuff tear was evaluated by micro-CT, biomechanical determination and histochemical staining methods. The results showed that the exosomes of polyaspartic acid-polylactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer (PASP-PLGA) microcapsules were successfully established which showed good stability and targeting. The bone mineral density (BMD), tissue mineral density (TMD) and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) were higher, while the stiffness and the ultimate load strength of the tendon interface were enhanced under treatment with exosomes of PASP-PLGA microcapsules. Histochemical staining showed that exosomes of PASP-PLGA microcapsules promoted tendon and bone interface healing after rotator cuff injury. The tendon regeneration- and cartilage differentiation-related protein expressions were significantly upregulated under treatment with exosomes of PASP-PLGA microcapsules.

Stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) provide another choice for osteoporosis therapy. Mouse mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs)-derived EVs promote bone regeneration; however, their clinical application is limited due to non-specific tissue targeting. Alendronate specifically targets bone tissue via hydroxyapatite. Therefore, EVs were combined with alendronate to generate Ale-EVs by ""click chemistry"" to facilitate EVs targeting bone via alendronate/hydroxyapatite binding. METHODS: Ale-EVs were characterized based on size using dynamic light scattering analysis and morphology was visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Hydroxyapatite affinity of Ale-EVs was detected by flow cytometry. Bone targeting of Ale-EVs was tested by ex vivo ﬂuorescent imaging. Cell viability was assessed by using WST-8 reduction assay kit for testing the ability of Ale-EVs to promote mMSCs proliferation. Alkaline phosphatase experiment was used to detect ability of Ale-EVs to promote differentiation of mouse mesenchymal stem cells in vitro. Western blotting and Q-PCR assay were used to detect the early marker of osteogenic differentiation. Antiosteoporotic effects of Ale-EVs were detected in ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis rat model. The safety of the Ale-EVs in vivo was measured by H&E staining and serum markers assay. RESULTS: In vitro, Ale-EVs had high affinity with hydroxyapatite. Also, ex vivo data indicated that Ale-EVs-DiD treatment of mice induced strong ﬂuorescece in bone tissues compared with EVs-DiD group. Furthermore, results suggested that Ale-EVs promoted the growth and differentiation of mouse MSCs. They also protected against osteoporosis in ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporotic rats. Ale-EVs were well tolerated and no side effects were found, indicating that Ale-EVs specifically target bone and can be used as a new therapeutic in osteoporosis treatment. CONCLUSION: We used the Ale-N3 to modify mouse mesenchymal stem cells-derived extracellular vesicles by copper-free ""click chemistry"" to generate a Ale-EVs system. The Ale-EVs had a high affinity for bone and have great potential for clinical applications in osteoporosis therapy with low systemic toxicity.","2020","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","7967-7977","","","15","","Int J Nanomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33116512 PMCID: PMC7573321","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\XFCQ9GBE\Wang et al. - 2020 - Bone-Targeted Extracellular Vesicles from Mesenchy.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116512","","Animals; Bone and Bones; Bone Regeneration; bone-targeting; Cell Differentiation; Cell Survival; click chemistry; EVs; extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Female; Humans; mesenchymal stem cells; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; MSCs; Osteogenesis; osteoporosis; Osteoporosis; Rats","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The CCK-8 assay, scratch wound assay, alkaline phosphatase activity assay, and alizarin red staining were used to evaluate the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Subsequently, a bio-scaffold, ADSCs-Exos modified gelatin sponge/polydopamine scaffold (GS-PDA-Exos), were prepared. After characterized by scanning electron microscopy and exosomes release assay, the repair effect of the GS-PDA-Exos scaffold on BMSCs and bone defects was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Results: The diameter of ADSCs-exos is around 122.1 nm and high expressed exosome-specific markers CD9 and CD63. ADSCs-Exos promote the proliferation migration and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. ADSCs-Exos was combined with gelatin sponge by polydopamine (PDA)coating and released slowly. After exposed to the GS-PDA-Exos scaffold, BMSCs have more calcium nodules with osteoinductive medium and higher expression the mRNA of osteogenic related genes compared with other groups.

Exosomes (Exo) are thought to play a part in bone regeneration and healing as key players in cell-to-cell contact. The object of this work was to determine whether exosomes derived from DO and BF serum could stimulate the Osteogenic Differentiation in these two processes, and if so, which genes could be involved. METHODS: The osteogenesis in DO-gap or BF-gap was evaluated using radiographic analysis and histological analysis. On the 14th postoperative day, DO-Exos and BF-Exos were isolated and cocultured with the jaw of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (JBMMSCs). Proliferation, migration and osteogenic differentiation of JBMMSCs were ascertained, after which exosomes RNA-seq was performed to identify the relevant gene. RESULTS: Radiographic and histological analyses manifested that osteogenesis was remarkably accelerated in DO-gap in comparison with BF-gap. Both of the two types of Exos were taken up by JBMMSCs, and their migration and osteogenic differentiation were also seen to improve. However, the proliferation showed no significant difference. Finally, exosome RNA-seq revealed that the lncRNA MSTRG.532277.1 and the mRNA F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 14(FBXL14) may play a key role in DO. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that exosomes from serum exert a critical effect on the rapid osteogenesis in DO. This promoting effect might have relevance with the co-expression of MSTRG.532277.1 and FBXL14.

While they have a defined therapeutic potential, the spatial and temporal control of their activity in vivo remains a challenge. The objective of this study was to devise a methodology to encapsulate EVs in 3D hydrogels for prolonged delivery. To achieve this, we have leveraged the MSC EV interactions with ECM proteins and their derivative peptides. Using osteoinductive functionally engineered EVs (FEEs) derived from MSCs, we show that FEEs bind to mimetic peptides from collagen (DGEA, GFPGER) and fibronectin (RGD). In in vitro experiments, photocrosslinkable alginate hydrogels containing RGD were able to encapsulate, tether and retain the FEEs over a period of 7 days while maintaining the structural integrity and osteoinductive functionality of the EVs. When employed in a calvarial defect model in vivo, alginate-RGD hydrogels containing the FEEs enhanced bone regeneration by a factor of 4 compared to controls lacking FEEs and by a factor of 2 compared to controls lacking the tethering peptide. These results show that EVs can be tethered to biomaterials to promote bone repair and the importance of prolonged delivery in vivo. Results also provide a prelude to the possible use of this technology for controlled delivery of EVs for other regenerative medicine applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The beneficial effects of human MSC (HMSC) therapy are attributable to paracrine effects of the HMSC derived EVs. While EV engineering has the potential to impact several fields of regenerative medicine, targeted delivery of the engineered EVs with spatial and temporal control is necessary to prevent off-target effects and enhance tissue specificity. Here, we have leveraged the interactions of MSC EVs with ECM proteins to develop a tethering system that can be utilized to prolong EV delivery in vivo while maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the EVs. Our work has provided a tunable platform for EV delivery that we envision can be formulated as an injectable material or a bulk hydrogel suitable for regenerative medicine applications.","2021-05","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","199-210","","","126","","Acta Biomater","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33741538 PMCID: PMC8096714","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\ALTPWYWP\Huang et al. - 2021 - 3D Encapsulation and tethering of functionally eng.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33741538","","Alginate; Animals; Bone regeneration; Bone Regeneration; Controlled release; Exosomes; Extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; Hydrogels; Integrins; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Regenerative Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigates the functions of EVs derived from bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) in osteoporosis (OP) and the molecular mechanism. EVs were isolated from primary BMSCs in mice. A mouse model with OP was induced by ovariectomy. Treatment with EVs restored bone mass and strength, attenuated trabecular bone loss and cartilage damage, and increased osteogenesis while suppressing osteoclastogenesis in ovariectomized mice. In vitro, the EVs treatment improved the osteogenic differentiation of MC-3T3 while inhibiting osteoclastic differentiation of RAW264.7 cells. Microarray analysis revealed a significant upregulation of ubiquitin specific peptidase 7 (USP7) expression in mouse bone tissues following EV treatment. USP7 was found to interact with Yes1 associated transcriptional regulator (YAP1) and stabilize YAP1 protein through deubiquitination modification. YAP1-related genes were enriched in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and overexpression of YAP1 promoted the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Functional experiments underscored the critical role of maintaining USP7, YAP1, and β-catenin levels in the pro-osteogenic and anti-osteoclastogenic properties of the BMSC-EVs. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that USP7, delivered by BMSC-derived EVs, stabilizes YAP1 protein, thereby ameliorating bone formation in OP through the Wnt/β-catenin activation.","2023-11","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","115829","","","217","","Biochem Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37748664","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37748664","","Animals; beta Catenin; Bone Marrow Cells; Cell Differentiation; Deubiquitination; Extracellular Vesicles; Female; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Osteogenesis; Osteoporosis; Protein Stability; Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7; Up-Regulation; USP7; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Wnt/β-catenin signaling; YAP1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite their potential, EVs short half-life following systemic administration hinders their therapeutic efficacy. EVs have been reported to bind to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and play an essential role in matrix mineralisation. Chitosan and collagen type I are naturally-derived pro-osteogenic biomaterials, which have been demonstrated to control EV release kinetics. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an injectable ECM-mimetic hydrogel capable of controlling the release of osteoblast-derived EVs to promote bone repair. Pure chitosan hydrogels significantly enhanced compressive modulus (2.48-fold) and osteogenic differentiation (3.07-fold), whilst reducing gelation times (2.09-fold) and proliferation (2.7-fold) compared to pure collagen gels (p ≤ 0.001). EV release was strongly associated with collagen concentration (R2 > 0.94), where a significantly increased EV release profile was observed from chitosan containing gels using the CD63 ELISA (p ≤ 0.001). Hydrogel-released EVs enhanced human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) proliferation (1.12-fold), migration (2.55-fold), and mineralisation (3.25-fold) compared to untreated cells (p ≤ 0.001). Importantly, EV-functionalised chitosan-collagen composites significantly promoted hBMSCs extracellular matrix mineralisation when compared to the EV-free gels in a dose-dependent manner (p ≤ 0.001). Taken together, these findings demonstrate the development of a pro-osteogenic thermosensitive chitosan-collagen hydrogel capable of enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of osteoblast-derived EVs as a novel acellular tool for bone augmentation strategy.","2022","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","829969","","","10","","Front Bioeng Biotechnol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35433655 PMCID: PMC9005798","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\MEJC9T38\Man et al. - 2022 - An ECM-Mimetic Hydrogel to Promote the Therapeutic.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35433655","","bone; controlled release; drug delivery; extracellular vesicle; hydrogel; tissue engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to immobilize IL4, polycaprolactone surfaces were modified using the PIII technology. No discernible alterations were found between the morphology before and after PIII treatment or IL4 immobilization. IL4-immobilized PIII surfaces polarized macrophages to an M2 phenotype and mitigated inflammatory cytokine production under lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Interestingly, the co-culture of macrophages (on IL4-immobilized PIII surfaces) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells enhanced the production of angiogenic and osteogenic factors and triggered autophagy activation. Exosomes produced by PIII + IL4-stimulated macrophages were also found to play a role in osteoblast differentiation.

Results demonstrated that pTa acts as a core scaffold for cell adhesion and exhibits good biocompatibility. Moreover, micro‑CT scan results as well as histological examination demonstrated that pTa had a significant effect on osteogenesis, with the addition of exosomes further promoting bone tissue regeneration and repair.

This study investigated the potential of 3D printed titanium scaffolds coated with hydroxyapatite to promote the therapeutic efficacy of osteoblast-derived EVs. Ti6Al4V titanium scaffolds with different pore sizes (500 and 1000 µm) and shapes (square and triangle) were fabricated by selective laser melting. A bone-mimetic nano-needle hydroxyapatite (nnHA) coating was then applied. EVs were procured from scaffold-cultured osteoblasts over 2 weeks and vesicle concentration was determined using the CD63 ELISA. Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) following treatment with primed EVs was evaluated by assessing alkaline phosphatase activity, collagen production and calcium deposition. Triangle pore scaffolds significantly increased osteoblast mineralisation (1.5-fold) when compared to square architectures (P ≤ 0.001). Interestingly, EV yield was also significantly enhanced on these higher permeability structures (P ≤ 0.001), in particular (2.2-fold) for the larger pore structures (1000 µm). Furthermore osteoblast-derived EVs isolated from triangular pore scaffolds significantly increased hBMSCs mineralisation when compared to EVs acquired from square pore scaffolds (1.7-fold) and 2D culture (2.2-fold) (P ≤ 0.001). Coating with nnHA significantly improved osteoblast mineralisation (>2.6-fold) and EV production (4.5-fold) when compared to uncoated scaffolds (P ≤ 0.001).

Considering the limited sources and bone regeneration efficiency of human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs), we explored whether exosomes secreted by stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED-exo) could improve the pluripotency and regenerative potential of hPDLCs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In hPDLCs, cell proliferation, migration, cell cycle, apoptosis, and osteogenic differentiation were detected after cells were exposed to SHED-exo (SHED-exo group), blank (control group), or control supernatant without exo (Csup group), via CCK-8, scratch analysis, flow cytometric, real-time PCR, and so on. Exosomes sequencing was performed to compare and analyze miRNAs contented in SHED-exo and hPDLC-exo. RESULTS: As compared to control or Csup, SHED-exo significantly increased migration, apoptosis, and proliferation, promoted cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase in hPDLCs, and enhanced Runx2 expression and mineralization. In addition, it may be explained by the significant differences in miRNA contented in SHED-exo and hPDLC-exo.

Recently, the development of biomaterials with the addiction of stem cells is giving promising results for the treatment of bone defects. In particular, it was demonstrated that scaffolds enriched with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and/or their derivatives, such as conditioned medium (CM) and extracellular vesicles (EVs), may improve bone regeneration. Moreover, given the deep link between osteogenesis and angiogenesis, a successful approach must also take into consideration the development of vascularization.

We evaluated also their capacity to induce angiogenic factors. At first, in vitro results showed an increased expression of osteogenic markers in hPDLSCs cultured with the 3D-COL and PEI-EVs, associated also with the increased protein levels of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). The increased expression of these proteins was confirmed also in vivo in rats implanted with the 3D-COL enriched with hPDLSCs and PEI-EVs. Moreover, histological examination evidenced in this group of rats the activation of bone regeneration and of the vascularization process. Also MicroCT imaging with morphometric analysis confirmed in rats transplanted with 3D-COL enriched with hPDLSCs and PEI-EVs an important regenerative process and a better integration level.

MSCs are known to reside in low oxygen tension, which promotes osteogenic differentiation via hypoxia-inducible factor-1α activation. Epigenetic reprogramming has emerged as a promising bioengineering strategy to enhance MSC differentiation. Particularly, the process of hypomethylation may enhance osteogenesis through gene activation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of inducing hypomethylation and hypoxia on improving the therapeutic efficacy of EVs derived from human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSCs). The effects of the hypoxia mimetic agent deferoxamine (DFO) and the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (AZT) on hBMSC viability was assessed by quantifying the DNA content. The epigenetic functionality was evaluated by assessing histone acetylation and histone methylation. hBMSC mineralisation was determined by quantifying alkaline phosphate activity, collagen production and calcium deposition. EVs were procured from AZT, DFO or AZT/DFO-treated hBMSCs over a two-week period, with EV size and concentration defined using transmission electron microscopy, nanoflow cytometry and dynamic light scattering. The effects of AZT-EVs, DFO-EVs or AZT/DFO-EVs on the epigenetic functionality and mineralisation of hBMSCs were evaluated. Moreover, the effects of hBMSC-EVs on human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) angiogenesis was assessed by quantifying pro-angiogenic cytokine release. DFO and AZT caused a time-dose dependent reduction in hBMSC viability. Pre-treatment with AZT, DFO or AZT/DFO augmented the epigenetic functionality of the MSCs through increases in histone acetylation and hypomethylation. AZT, DFO and AZT/DFO pre-treatment significantly enhanced extracellular matrix collagen production and mineralisation in hBMSCs. EVs derived from AZT/DFO-preconditioned hBMSCs (AZT/DFO-EVs) enhanced the hBMSC proliferation, histone acetylation and hypomethylation when compared to EVs derived from AZT-treated, DFO-treated and untreated hBMSCs. Importantly, AZT/DFO-EVs significantly increased osteogenic differentiation and mineralisation of a secondary hBMSC population. Furthermore, AZT/DFO-EVs enhanced the pro-angiogenic cytokine release of HUVECs. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the considerable utility of synergistically inducing hypomethylation and hypoxia to improve the therapeutic efficacy of the MSC-EVs as a cell-free approach for bone regeneration.","2023-04-20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","7564","","8","24","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37108726 PMCID: PMC10142722","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\HY7T9IDK\Man et al. - 2023 - Epigenetic Reprogramming via Synergistic Hypomethy.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37108726","","bone; Cells, Cultured; Cytokines; DNA; Epigenesis, Genetic; epigenetics; extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Histones; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; hypoxia; Hypoxia; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; methylation; Osteogenesis; stem cells; tissue engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, promoting angiogenesis during the bone repair process is vital for ideal bone regeneration. As important mediators of cell-cell communication and biological homeostasis, mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEVs) have been proved to be highly involved in bone and vascular regeneration. Because hypoxia microenvironment promotes the proangiogenic activity of MSCs, in the present study, we investigate the effect and underlying molecular mechanisms of sEVs from hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs (hypo-sEVs) on angiogenesis and develop an effective strategy to promote vascularized bone regeneration. Compared to sEVs from normoxia MSCs (nor-sEVs), hypo-sEVs promoted the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of HUVECs and ultimately enhanced bone regeneration and new blood vessel reconstruction in a critical-size calvarial bone defect model. miRNA sequence and the verified results showed that miR-210-3p in hypo-sEVs was increased via HIF-1α under hypoxia. The upregulated miR-210-3p in hypo-sEVs promoted angiogenesis by downregulating EFNA3 expression and enhancing the phosphorylation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, this study suggests a successful strategy to enhance vascularized bone regeneration by utilizing hypo-sEVs via the miR-210-3p/EFNA3/PI3K/AKT pathway. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Considering the significance of vascularization in ideal bone regeneration, strategies to promote angiogenesis during bone repair are required. Hypoxia microenvironment can promote the proangiogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Nonetheless, the therapeutic effect of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs on cranio-maxillofacial bone defect remains unknown, and the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. This study shows that hypo-sEVs significantly enhance the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of HUVECs as well as promote vascularized bone formation. Moreover, this work indicates that HIF-1α can induce overexpression of miR-210-3p under hypoxia, and miR-210-3p can hinder EFNA3 expression and subsequently activate the PI3K/AKT pathway. The application of hypo-sEVs provides a facile and promising strategy to promote vascularized bone regeneration in a critical-size bone defect model.","2022-09-15","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","413-426","","","150","","Acta Biomater","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35850484","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35850484","","Angiogenesis; Bone Regeneration; Ephrin-A3; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; Hypoxia; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; MicroRNAs; miR-210-3p; MSC-sEVs; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Vascularized bone regeneration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: The osteogenic potential in bone defect repair of exosomes derived from diabetes mellitus BMSCs derived exosomes (DM-Exos) were revealed to be lower than that in normal BMSCs derived exosomes (N-Exos) in vitro and in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that miR-140-3p level was significantly altered in exosomes derived from BMSCs, ADSCs and serum from DM rats. In in vitro experiments, upregulated miR-140-3p exosomes promoted DM BMSCs differentiation into osteoblasts. The effects were exerted by miR-140-3p targeting plxnb1, plexin B1 is the receptor of semaphoring 4D(Sema4D) that inhibited osteocytes differentiation, thereby promoting bone formation. In DM rats with bone defect, miR-140-3p upregulated exosomes were transplanted into injured bone and accelerated bone regeneration. Besides, miR-140-3p in the exosomes was transferred into BMSCs and osteoblasts and promoted bone regeneration by targeting the plexin B1/RohA/ROCK signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Normal-Exos and miR-140-3p overexpressed-Exos accelerated diabetic wound healing by promoting the osteoblastogenesis function of BMSCs through inhibition plexin B1 expression which is the receptor of Sema4D and the plexin B1/RhoA/ROCK pathway compared with diabetes mellitus-Exos. This offers a new insight and a new therapy for treating diabetic bone unhealing.","2022-03-02","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","97","","1","20","","J Nanobiotechnology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35236339 PMCID: PMC8889728","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\AYIRRZZQ\Wang et al. - 2022 - Increased BMSC exosomal miR-140-3p alleviates bone.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35236339","","Animals; Bone defect; Cell Proliferation; Diabetes mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Exosomes; GTPase-Activating Proteins; Humans; MicroRNAs; MiR-140-3p; Plexin B1; Rats; Receptors, Cell Surface","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to compare the therapeutic benefit of EVs obtained from adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSC) on bone repair whereas using ß-tricalcium phosphate (ß-TCP) biomaterial as a carrier. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A single critical size bone defect of 8 mm in diameter was created on the right side of rat calvarium using a custom-made punch needle. Animals were randomly divided into 5 groups: group 1 (no treatment), group 2 (bone graft), group 3 (ß-TCP + ADSC), group 4 (ß-TCP + EV), group 5 (ß-TCP). Eight weeks later, animals were sacrificed and histologic and radiologic evaluation was performed. RESULTS: Semiquantitative histologic scoring demonstrated significantly higher bone regeneration scores for groups 2, 3, and 4 compared to group 1. Radiologic imaging showed significantly higher bone mineral density for groups 2, 3, and 5 compared to group 1. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in either histologic or radiologic scoring. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that EVs provided from thermally induced ADSCs did not show any significant difference in bone regeneration when compared to ADSCs themselves. Future studies should focus on determining the optimum amount and content of EV application since these vary significantly depending on the microenvironment.","2021-09-01","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","2245-2250","","6","32","","J Craniofac Surg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34516061","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34516061","","Adipose Tissue; Animals; Bone Regeneration; Extracellular Vesicles; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Osteogenesis; Rats; Stem Cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The different formation mechanisms suggest that exosomes and ectosomes possess different biological functions. However, little attention has been paid to the differential effects of EV subsets on cartilage regeneration. METHODS: Our study compared the effects of the two EVs isolated from adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) on chondrocytes and bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) in vitro. Additionally, we loaded the two EVs into type I collagen hydrogels to optimize their application for the treatment of osteochondral defects in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro experiments demonstrate that ASC-derived exosomes (ASC-Exos) significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of both cells more effectively than ASC-derived ectosomes (ASC-Ectos). Furthermore, ASC-Exos facilitated a stronger differentiation of BMSCs into chondrogenic cells than ASC-Ectos, but both inhibited chondrocyte apoptosis to a similar extent. In the osteochondral defect model of rats, ASC-Exos promoted cartilage regeneration in situ better than ASC-Ectos. At 8 weeks, the hydrogel containing exosomes group (Gel + Exo group) had higher macroscopic and histological scores, a higher value of trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV), a lower value of trabecular thickness (Tb.Sp), and a better remodeling of extracellular matrix than the hydrogel containing ectosomes group (Gel + Ecto group). At 4 and 8 weeks, the expression of CD206 and Arginase-1 in the Gel + Exo group was significantly higher than that in the Gel + Ecto group.

METHODS: We isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) from periodontal stem cells (PDLSCs) and loaded with aspirin by sonication, and then evaluated the treatment efficacy of aspirin-loaded vesicles (EVs-ASP) in periodontitis model in mice. In vitro, we explored the role of EVs-ASP in the regulation of LPS-induced macrophages. The underlying mechanism by which EVs-ASP regulates phenotypic remodeling of macrophages in periodontitis was further investigated. RESULTS: EVs-ASP inhibited the inflammatory environment of LPS-induced macrophage, and promoted anti-inflammatory macrophages formation both in vivo and in vitro, and reduced bone loss in periodontitis models. Moreover, EVs-ASP enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and suppressed glycolysis in macrophages.

Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), which are MSCs isolated from pulp tissue, are less invasive to the body than other MSCs and can be collected from young individuals. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of EVs secreted by DPSCs (DPSC-EVs) for bone formation. METHODS: DPSC-EVs were isolated from the cell culture medium of DPSCs. DPSC-EVs were unilaterally injected along with collagen (COL), beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) or hydroxyapatite (HA) into rat calvarial bone defects. The effects of DPSC-EVs were analyzed by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histological observation. RESULTS: Micro-CT showed that administration of DPSC-EVs with the abovementioned scaffolds resulted in bone formation in the periphery of the defects. DPSC-EVs/COL specifically resulted in bone formation in the center of the defects. Histological observation revealed that DPSC-EVs/COL promoted new bone formation. Administration of DPSC-EVs/COL had almost the same effect on the bone defect site as transplantation of DPSCs/COL.

Nucleic Acids","","2162-2531","10.1016/j.omtn.2021.01.031","","Activated osteoclasts release large amounts of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) during bone remodeling. However, little is known about whether osteoclast-derived sEVs affect surrounding cells. In this study, osteoclasts were generated by stimulating bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) with macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear actor κB ligand (RANKL). We performed microarray analysis of sEV-microRNAs (miRNAs)s secreted from osteoclast at different stages and identified four miRNAs that were highly expressed in mature osteoclast-derived sEVs. One of these miRNAs, miR-324, significantly induced osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro by targeting ARHGAP1, a negative regulator of osteogenic differentiation. We next fabricated an sEV-modified scaffold by coating decalcified bone matrix (DBM) with osteoclast-derived sEVs, and the pro-osteogenic regeneration activities of the sEV-modified scaffold were validated in a mouse calvarial defect model. Notably, miR-324-enriched sEV-modified scaffold showed the highest capacity on bone regeneration, whereas inhibition of miR-324 in sEVs abrogated these effects. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-324-contained sEVs released from mature osteoclast play an essential role in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation and potentially bridge the coupling between osteoclasts and MSCs.","2021-03-05","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","1191-1203","","","23","","Mol Ther Nucleic Acids","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33664997 PMCID: PMC7900016","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\GQYAUVCE\Liang et al. - 2021 - Osteoclast-derived small extracellular vesicles in.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33664997","","extracellular vesicles; osteoclast; osteogenic differentiation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although EVs' potential for bone regeneration has been shown, issues associated with their therapeutic potency and short half-life in vivo hinders their clinical utility. Epigenetic reprogramming with the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) has been reported to promote the osteoinductive potency of osteoblast-derived EVs. Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels functionalised with the synthetic nanoclay laponite (LAP) have been shown to effectively bind, stabilise, and improve the retention of bioactive factors. This study investigated the potential of utilising a GelMA-LAP hydrogel to improve local retention and control delivery of epigenetically enhanced osteoblast-derived EVs as a novel bone repair strategy. LAP was found to elicit a dose-dependent increase in GelMA compressive modulus and shear-thinning properties. Incorporation of the nanoclay was also found to enhance shape fidelity when 3D printed compared to LAP-free gels. Interestingly, GelMA hydrogels containing LAP displayed increased mineralisation capacity (1.41-fold) (p ≤ 0.01) over 14 days. EV release kinetics from these nanocomposite systems were also strongly influenced by LAP concentration with significantly more vesicles being released from GelMA constructs as detected by a CD63 ELISA (p ≤ 0.001). EVs derived from TSA-treated osteoblasts (TSA-EVs) enhanced proliferation (1.09-fold), migration (1.83-fold), histone acetylation (1.32-fold) and mineralisation (1.87-fold) of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) when released from the GelMA-LAP hydrogel compared to the untreated EV gels (p ≤ 0.01). Importantly, the TSA-EV functionalised GelMA-LAP hydrogel significantly promoted encapsulated hBMSCs extracellular matrix collagen production (≥1.3-fold) and mineralisation (≥1.78-fold) in a dose-dependent manner compared to untreated EV constructs (p ≤ 0.001). Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potential of combining epigenetically enhanced osteoblast-derived EVs with a nanocomposite photocurable hydrogel to promote the therapeutic efficacy of acellular vesicle approaches for bone regeneration.","2022-01-13","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","832","","2","23","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35055017 PMCID: PMC8775793","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\M9WG8DUU\Man et al. - 2022 - Controlled Release of Epigenetically-Enhanced Extr.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35055017","","bone; Bone Regeneration; Chemical Phenomena; Clay; drug delivery; epigenetics; Extracellular Matrix; extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Gelatin; Humans; hydrogel; Hydrogels; Hydroxamic Acids; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Methacrylates; Nanogels; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; Silicates; tissue engineering; Tissue Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proliferation, migration and osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cell (PDLSC) are crucial to the regeneration of periodontal bone defects. There is increasing evidence that small extracellular vesicle (sEV) derived from pulp stem cell, including human exfoliated deciduous teeth stem cell (SHED) and human dental pulp stem cell (DPSC), is a potential mediator for bone tissue regeneration. However, which one is more suitable for periodontal bone formation still remains to be studied. METHODS: In this study, NTA and BCA were performed to compare the productivity of sEV derived from SHED (SHED-sEV) and sEV derived from DPSC (DPSC-sEV). CCK-8, transwell assay, alkaline phosphatase staining and activity assay, alizarin red staining, qRT-PCR, and western blotting were conducted to detect the proliferation, migration, and osteogenesis of PDLSCs coculturing with SHED-sEV or DPSC-sEV. RESULTS: The secretory efficiency of SHED-sEV was much higher than that of DPSC-sEV. The cellular uptake of sEVs could promote the proliferation, migration and osteogenesis of DPLSCs. Compared with DPSC-sEV, SHED-sEV showed better ability in such promotion. CONCLUSIONS: SHED-sEV showed higher productivity and better osteogenic induction ability than DPSC-sEV.

In bone turn over, at the end of bone resorption phase, most osteoclasts undergo apoptosis, generating large amounts of ABs. However, it remains unclear of the role of osteoclast-derived ABs in bone remodeling. Methods: Staurosporine (STS) was used to apoptotic induction and differential centrifugation was used to isolate ABs. Western blotting, flowcytometry and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed for ABs identification, while whole transcriptome of ABs from osteoclasts at different stages was detected by RNA-seq. VENN analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed to compare the profile similarities between ABs and parental cells. In vitro efficacy of ABs on angiogenesis and osteogenesis were evaluated by tube formation assay and ALP staining. In vivo, calvarial defect mice model was used to assess the effects of ABs-modified decalcified bone matrix (DBM) scaffolds on angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Results: Here we mapped the whole transcriptome paralleled with small RNA profiling of osteoclast derived ABs at distinct differentiation stages. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed significant differences in RNA signatures among the ABs generated from osteoclasts at different stages. By comparing with parental osteoclast RNA profiles, we found that the transcriptome of ABs exhibited high similarities with the corresponding parental cells. Functionally, in vitro and in vivo studies showed that similar with the parental cells, pOC-ABs potentiated endothelial progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, whereas mOC-ABs promoted osteogenic differentiation. The inherited biological effects of ABs were shown mediated by several enriched lncRNAs of which the interference abolished AB functions. Conclusions: Our study revealed the total RNA profiles of osteoclast derived ABs and demonstrated their biological functions. Both gene set and functional analysis indicated that osteoclast derived ABs are biologically similar with the parental cells suggesting their bridging role in osteoclast-osteoblast coupling in bone remodeling.","2020","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","6825-6838","","15","10","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32550906 PMCID: PMC7295057","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\5YLMJ5VE\Ma et al. - 2020 - Osteoclast-derived apoptotic bodies show extended .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32550906","","Animals; Apoptotic body; Bone Marrow; Bone remodeling; Bone Resorption; Cell coupling; Cell Differentiation; Disease Models, Animal; Extracellular Vesicles; Macrophages; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Osteoclast; Osteoclasts; Osteogenesis; Transcriptome; Vesicle bioinformatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The balance of oxidative stress and the coupling of vessel and bone ingrowth are critical for bone regeneration. In this study, an injectable heterogeneous silk gel scaffold which can spatiotemporally and sustainedly release bone mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles, HIF-1α pathway activator, and inhibitor is developed for bone repair and vertebral reinforcement. The initial enhancement of HIF-1α upregulates the expression of VEGF to promote angiogenesis, and the balance of reactive oxygen species level is regulated to effectively eliminate oxidative damage and abnormal microenvironment.

Bio","","2590-0064","10.1016/j.mtbio.2022.100434","","Repairing critical bone defects is a complex problem in the clinic. The periosteum rich in nerve plays a vital role in initiating and regulating bone regeneration. However, current studies have paid little attention to repairing nerves in the periosteum to promote bone regeneration. Thus, it is essential to construct bionic periosteum with the targeted injured nerves in the periosteum. We coupled phosphatidylserine (PS) targeted aptamers with repair Schwann cell exosomes to construct exosome@aptamer (EA). Then through PEI, EA was successfully built on the surface of the electrospun fiber, which was PCL@PEI@exosome@aptamer (PPEA). Through SEM, TEM, and other technologies, PPEA was characterized. Experiments prove in vivo and in vitro that it has an excellent repair effect on damaged nerves and regeneration of vascular and bones. In vivo, we confirmed that biomimetic periosteum has an apparent ability to promote nerve and bone regeneration by using Microcomputer tomography, hematoxylin-eosin, Masson, and Immunofluorescence. In vitro, we used Immunofluorescence, Real-Time Quantitative PCR, Alkaline phosphatase staining, and other tests to confirm that it has central nerve, blood vessel, and bone regeneration ability. The PPEA biomimetic periosteum has apparent neurogenic, angiogenic, and osteogenic effects. The PPEA biomimetic periosteum will provide a promising method for treating bone defects.","2022-12","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","100434","","","16","","Mater Today Bio","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36186848 PMCID: PMC9519612","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\ICCC9GW6\Su et al. - 2022 - Aptamer engineering exosomes loaded on biomimetic .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36186848","","Aptamer; Bone regeneration; Electrospinning; Engineering exosomes; Nerve regeneration; Repaired schwann cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patient with diabetes have increased risks of bone fracture. Previous studies report that diabetes could affect bone metabolism, however, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. METHODS: We isolated exosomes secreted by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells of normal and diabetic mice and test their effects on osteogenesis and adipogenesis. Then we screened the differential microRNAs by high-throughput sequencing and explored the function of key microRNA in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We find that lower bone mass and higher marrow fat accumulation, also called bone-fat imbalance, exists in diabetic mouse model. Exosomes secreted by normal bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs-Exos) enhanced osteogenesis and suppressed adipogenesis, while these effects were diminished in diabetic BMSCs-Exos. miR-221, as one of the highly expressed miRNAs within diabetic BMSCs-Exos, showed abilities of suppressing osteogenesis and promoting adipogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Elevation of miR-221 level in normal BMSCs-Exos impairs the ability of regulating osteogenesis and adipogenesis. Intriguingly, using the aptamer delivery system, delivery normal BMSCs-Exos specifically to BMSCs increased bone mass, reduced marrow fat accumulation, and promoted bone regeneration in diabetic mice. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that BMSCs derived exosomal miR-221 is a key regulator of diabetic osteoporosis, which may represent a potential therapeutic target for diabetes-related skeletal disorders.","2023","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","1149168","","","14","","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37124755 PMCID: PMC10145165","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37124755","","Animals; Bone and Bones; bone-fat imbalance; diabetes; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; exosomes; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; MicroRNAs; miR-221; Osteogenesis; osteoporosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the secretomes in MSC-CM that act as active ingredients for bone regeneration, as well as their mechanisms, remains unclear. Exosomes, components of MSC-CM, provide the recipient cells with genetic information and enhance the recipient cellular paracrine stimulation, which contributes to tissue regeneration. We hypothesized that MSC-CM-derived exosomes (MSC-Exo) promoted bone regeneration, and that angiogenesis was a key step. Here, we prepared an MSC-Exo group, MSC-CM group, and Exo-antiVEGF group (MSC-Exo with angiogenesis inhibitor), and examined the osteogenic and angiogenic potential in MSCs. Furthermore, we used a rat model of calvaria bone defect and implanted each sample to evaluate bone formation weekly, until week 4 after treatment. Results showed that MSC-Exo enhanced cellular migration and osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression in MSCs compared to that in other groups. In vivo, early bone formation by MSC-Exo was also confirmed. Two weeks after implantation, the newly formed bone area was 31.5 ± 6.5% in the MSC-Exo group while those in the control and Exo-antiVEGF groups were 15.4 ± 4.4% and 8.7 ± 1.1%, respectively. Four weeks after implantation, differences in the area between the MSC-Exo group and the Exo-antiVEGF or control groups were further broadened. Histologically, notable accumulation of osteoblast-like cells and vascular endothelial cells was observed in the MSC-Exo group; however, fewer cells were found in the Exo-antiVEGF and control groups. In conclusion, MSC-Exo promoted bone regeneration during early stages, as well as enhanced angiogenesis. Considering the tissue regeneration with transplanted cells and their secretomes, this study suggests that exosomes might play an important role, especially in angiogenesis.","2019","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","e0225472","","11","14","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31751396 PMCID: PMC6872157","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31751396","","Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Animals; Bone Regeneration; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Culture Media, Conditioned; Disease Models, Animal; Exosomes; Humans; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Paracrine Communication; Rats; Skull","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inflammation and vascular impairment are two main causes of inadequate wound healing. Methods: Here, we developed a versatile hydrogel wound dressing, comprising a straightforward physical mixture of royal jelly-derived extracellular vesicles (RJ-EVs) and methacrylic anhydride modified sericin (SerMA), to accelerate wound healing by inhibiting inflammation and promoting vascular reparation. Results: The RJ-EVs showed satisfactory anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and significantly promoted L929 cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Meanwhile, the photocrosslinked SerMA hydrogel with its porous interior structure and high fluidity made it a good candidate for wound dressing. The RJ-EVs can be gradually released from the SerMA hydrogel at the wound site, ensuring the restorative effect of RJ-EVs. In a full-thickness skin defect model, the SerMA/RJ-EVs hydrogel dressing accelerated wound healing with a healing rate of 96.8% by improving cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The RNA sequencing results further revealed that the SerMA/RJ-EVs hydrogel dressing was involved in inflammatory damage repair-related pathways including recombinational repair, epidermis development, and Wnt signaling.

Next, we extracted the sEVs from the hMSC, which were cultured on the nanotopographical Ti plates for 21 days (Ti8-21-sEV). We demonstrated that Ti8-21-sEV had superior pro-osteogenesis ability in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing further confirmed that Ti8-21-sEV promote bone regeneration through osteogenic-related pathways, including the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction. Finally, we decorated the Ti8-21-sEV on a 3D printed porous polyetheretherketone scaffold. The femoral condyle defect model of rabbits was used to demonstrate that Ti8-21-sEV had the best bone ingrowth.

This study aimed to investigate the potential effects and mechanisms of M1 macrophage small extracellular vesicles during rat MPS expansion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RAW264.7 cells were induced to M1 or M2 polarization and, small extracellular vesicles were isolated from the polarized macrophages. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (6-7 weeks) were administered 70 ± 5 g expansion force devices for 7 days. Rats with expanders without force served as controls. M1/M2 small extracellular vesicles were injected into the MPS region (50 µg/day) in the M1 and M2 small extracellular vesicle-assisted groups, while 0.9% saline was injected into the expansion-only group. Suture width, bone mass, and morphological changes in the region of interest (ROI) were examined. RESULTS: The M1 small extracellular vesicle-assisted group showed a significantly increased MPS suture width in vivo (P < 0.001), and less bone mass was observed in the ROI (P < 0.05). Histological examination showed that the M1 small extracellular vesicle-assisted group exhibited a wider palatal area and obvious fibrous tissue rearrangement. The expression of RANKL and the number of osteoclasts were increased (P < 0.01) in the bony edges, and the p65 protein expression was significantly higher (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: M1 macrophage-derived small extracellular vesicles have a positive effect in MPS expansion and increase p65 protein content and RANKL expression, thus promoting bone turnover.

However, the biological roles of osteoclast-derived ABs (OC-ABs) in bone remodeling have not been investigated and remain unknown. In this study, we stimulated bone marrow macrophages with receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) to obtain both preosteoclasts and mature osteoclasts (mOCs). We then used alendronate to induce apoptosis in preosteoclasts and mOCs and generate the respective ABs and used flow cytometry and immunoblotting to characterize the sizes and immunogenic characteristics of the extracted ABs. We show that mOC-ABs are engulfed by preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and promote the viability of these cells. Among all osteoclast-derived extracellular vesicles, mOC-ABs had the highest osteogenic potency. We further observed that mOC-ABs had the highest vesicular receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) levels among all types of osteoclast-derived extracellular vesicles. Of note, masking of vesicular RANK by soluble RANKL strongly abolished the osteogenic potency of osteoclast-derived ABs. Mechanistically, we found that mOC-ABs induce osteoblast differentiation by activatingPI3K/AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase signaling. In conclusion, OC-ABs promote osteogenic differentiation by stimulating osteoblast differentiation via activation of RANKL reverse signaling. These findings provide important insights into the reversal phase between the bone resorption and formation stages during bone remodeling and identify an AB-dependent cellular signaling mechanism in osteoclast-osteoblast coupling.","2019-07-19","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","11240-11247","","29","294","","J Biol Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31167789 PMCID: PMC6643026","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31167789","","3T3 Cells; Animals; apoptosis; bone; Bone Marrow Cells; bone remodeling; Bone Remodeling; cell coupling; cell differentiation; Cell Differentiation; Extracellular Vesicles; Macrophages; Mice; osteoblast; osteoclast; Osteoclasts; Osteogenesis; RANK Ligand","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies have shown that exosomes stimulate bone regeneration. Thus, it is worthwhile to explore whether exosomes could be a useful therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from hucMSCs. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed lncRNAs in myeloma-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Plasmids encoding LINC00520 or short hairpin RNA of LINC00520 were transfected into hucMSCs and then exosomes were isolated. After human osteoblasts hFOB1.19 were exposed to the obtained exosomes, cell survival, cell cycle, apoptosis and calcium deposits of hFOB1.19 cell were detected by MTT, 7-aminoactinomycin D, Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide and Alizarin red staining, respectively.

Herein, we addressed this issue in a temperature-responsive PF127 hydrogel loaded with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-derived exosomes (Exos) (PF127 hydrogel@BMSC-Exos) during alveolar bone regeneration. Genes enriched in BMSC-Exos and upregulated during the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and their downstream regulators were predicted by bioinformatics analyses. CTNNB1 was predicted to be the key gene of BMSC-Exos in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, during which miR-146a-5p, IRAK1, and TRAF6 might be the downstream factors. Osteogenic differentiation was induced in BMSCs, in which ectopic expression of CTNNB1 was introduced and from which Exos were isolated. The CTNNB1-enriched PF127 hydrogel@BMSC-Exos were constructed and implanted into in vivo rat models of alveolar bone defects. In vitro experiment data showed that PF127 hydrogel@BMSC-Exos efficiently delivered CTNNB1 to BMSCs, which subsequently promoted the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, as evidenced by enhanced ALP staining intensity and activity, extracellular matrix mineralization (p < 0.05), and upregulated RUNX2 and OCN expression (p < 0.05). Functional experiments were conducted to examine the relationships among CTNNB1, microRNA (miR)-146a-5p, and IRAK1 and TRAF6. Mechanistically, CTNNB1 activated miR-146a-5p transcription to downregulate IRAK1 and TRAF6 (p < 0.05), which induced the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and facilitated alveolar bone regeneration in rats (increased new bone formation and elevated BV/TV ratio and BMD, all with p < 0.05). Collectively, CTNNB1-containing PF127 hydrogel@BMSC-Exos promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by regulating the miR-146a-5p/IRAK1/TRAF6 axis, thus inducing the repair of alveolar bone defects in rats.","2023-03-16","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","1083","","6","13","","Nanomaterials (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36985977 PMCID: PMC10058633","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36985977","","alveolar bone defect; bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells; CTNNB1; exosomes; IRAK1; microRNA-146a-5p; osteogenic differentiation; temperature-responsive hydrogel; TRAF6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, an extracellular vesicles (EVs)-cloaked enzymatic nanohybrid (ENEV) was constructed to serve as a multifaceted biocatalyst for ultrasound (US)-augmented tendon matrix reconstruction and immune microenvironment regulation. The ENEV-based biocatalyst exhibits integrated merits for treating tendon injury, including the efficient catalase-mimetic scavenging of ROS in the injured tissue, sustainable release of Zn2+ ions, cellular uptake augmented by US, and immunoregulation induced by EVs. Our study suggests that ENEVs can promote tenocyte proliferation and type-I collagen synthesis at an early stage by protecting tenocytes from ROS attack. The ENEVs also prompted efficient immune regulation, as the polarization of macrophages (Mφ) was reversed from M1φ to M2φ. In a rat Achilles tendon defect model, the ENEVs combined with US treatment significantly promoted functional recovery and matrix reconstruction, restored tendon morphology, suppressed intratendinous scarring, and inhibited peritendinous adhesion.

The process of bone defect regeneration can be impaired by underlying diseases including DM, but the mechanism remains unclear. In bone tissue engineering, the integration of bionic coatings and bioactive components into basic scaffolds are common function-enhancing strategies. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have been applied for cell-free tissue regeneration in the last few years. We previously reported that sEVs have flexible and easily-extensible potential, through modular design and engineering modification. The impairment of CD31hiendomucinhi endothelial cells (ECs) whose function is coupling of osteogenesis and angiogenesis, is considered an important contributor to diabetic bone osteopathy, and ZEB1, which is highly expressed in CD31hiendomucinhi ECs, promotes angiogenesis-dependent bone formation. Thus we believe these ECs hold much promise for use in bone regeneration. In addition, c(RGDfC) has been reported to be a highly-effective peptide targeting αvβ3, which is highly expressed in the bone microenvironment. In this study, we developed a hyaluronic acid (HA)/poly-L-lysine (PLL) layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly coating on β-TCP (β-tricalcium phosphate) scaffolds providing immobilization of modularized engineered sEVs (with c(RGDfC) surface functionalization and ZEB1 loading) to facilitate bone defect regeneration under DM conditions. RNA-seq was used to explore possible molecular mechanisms, and the therapeutic effects of bone regeneration were systematically evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

In the present study, a new strategy to improve SB osteoinductivity was developed. SB scaffolds were loaded with lyosecretome, a freeze-dried formulation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-secretome, containing proteins and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Lyosecretome-loaded SB scaffolds (SBlyo) were prepared using an absorption method. A burst release of proteins and EVs (38% and 50% after 30 min, respectively) was observed, and then proteins were released more slowly with respect to EVs, most likely because they more strongly adsorbed onto the SB surface. In vitro tests were conducted using adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) plated on SB or SBlyo. After 14 days, significant cell proliferation improvement was observed on SBlyo with respect to SB, where cells filled the cavities between the native trabeculae. On SB, on the other hand, the process was still present, but tissue formation was less organized at 60 days. On both scaffolds, cells differentiated into osteoblasts and were able to mineralize after 60 days. Nonetheless, SBlyo showed a higher expression of osteoblast markers and a higher quantity of newly formed trabeculae than SB alone. The quantification analysis of the newly formed mineralized tissue and the immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that SBlyo induces bone formation more effectively. This osteoinductive effect is likely due to the osteogenic factors present in the lyosecretome, such as fibronectin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A, and TGF-β.","2021-04-14","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","4064","","8","22","","Int J Mol Sci","Biohybrid Bovine Bone Matrix for Controlled Release of Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cell Lyosecretome","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33920046 PMCID: PMC8071018","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33920046","","Animals; bone grafting; Bone Matrix; bone regeneration; Bone Regeneration; Bone Substitutes; Cattle; Cell Differentiation; Delayed-Action Preparations; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; mesenchymal stem cells; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; MSC-exosomes; MSC-extracellular vesicles; MSC-secretome; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; Plastic Surgery Procedures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold significant tissue regeneration promise. Silver nanoparticles (Ag) have been suggested as the surface modification technique for various medical devices. Materials and Methods: Ag and human bone marrow MSC (hBMSC)-derived exosomes (MSCs-exo) were used to modify the PCL scaffold. The impact of different scaffolds on immune cells and MSC proliferation and differentiation was further evaluated. Results: MSCs-exo exhibited cup-shaped morphology with a diameter around 100 nm. MSCs-exo were enriched with exosome marker CD81 and showed good internalization into recipient cells. 200 ng/ml Ag nanoparticles and MSCs-exo were further used to modify the PCL scaffold. The internalization study further indicated a similar releasing pattern of exosomes from Ag/MSCs-exo hybrid scaffolds into RAW264.7 and hBMSCs at 12 and 24 h, respectively. Macrophages play an important role during different stages of bone regeneration. The MTT and confocal microscopy study demonstrated no significant toxicity of exosome and/or Ag hybrid scaffolds for macrophages and MSCs. Inflammatory macrophages were further used to mimic the inflammatory environment. A mixed population of elongated and round morphology was noted in the exosome and Ag hybrid group, in which the proinflammatory genes and secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly reduced. In addition, the exosome and Ag hybrid scaffolds could significantly boost the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Discussion: This study highlights the possibility of using Ag nanoparticles and MSCs-exo to modify the PCL scaffold, thus providing new insight into the development of the novel immunomodulatory biomembrane.","2021","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","699802","","","9","","Front Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34409016 PMCID: PMC8365089","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34409016","","Ag; exosome; mesenchymal stem cells; osteogenesis; PCL hybrid scaffold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overall, the integrated repair of the structure and function of the osteochondral (OC) unit is very important. Some studies have demonstrated that the differentiation of cartilage is significantly enhanced by reducing the intake of nutrients such as lipids. This study demonstrates that using starvation can effectively optimize the therapeutic effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). A hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel containing starved BMSCs-EVs displayed continuous release for more than 3 weeks and significantly promoted the proliferation and biosynthesis of chondrocytes around the defect regulated by the forkhead-box class O (FOXO) pathway. When combined with vascular inhibitors, the hydrogel inhibited cartilage hypertrophy and facilitated the regeneration of hyaline cartilage. A porous methacrylate gelatine (GelMA)-based hydrogel containing calcium salt loaded with thrombin rapidly promoted haematoma formation upon contact with the bone marrow cavity to quickly block the pores and prevent the blood vessels in the bone marrow cavity from invading the cartilage layer. Furthermore, the haematoma could be used as nutrients to accelerate bone survival. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that the multifunctional lineage-specific hydrogel promoted the integrated regeneration of cartilage/subchondral bone. Thus, this hydrogel may represent a new strategy for osteochondral regeneration and repair.","2023-12","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","100800","","","23","","Mater Today Bio","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37766897 PMCID: PMC10520449","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37766897","","Haematoma; Hyaluronic acid; Lineage-specific scaffold; Osteochondral defects; Starved BMSCs-EVs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: First, synthesize the bionic composite hydrogel Gel-OCS/MBGN. Characterize it through field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and FTIR. Then, conduct performance tests such as rheology, dynamic mechanical analysis, in vitro mineralization, and degradation. Rat BMSCs were selected for in vitro cell experiments, and EVs derived from BMSCs were obtained by differential centrifugation. The EVs were loaded onto Gel-OCS/MBGN to obtain Gel-OCS/MBGN@EVs hydrogel. Cell viability and proliferation were detected by live/dead cell staining and CCK-8 assay, respectively. ALP and ARS staining was used to evaluate the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Differential gene expression analysis of osteogenic differentiation was performed using high-throughput sequencing. TargetScan database predicted the binding site between miR-19b-3p and WWP1, and a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the targeting binding site. A rat bone defect model was established, and new bone formation was evaluated by Micro-CT, H&E staining, and Masson's trichrome staining. Immunofluorescence staining and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression levels of osteogenic-related factors in rat BMSCs. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to detect the expression levels of genes and proteins in tissues and cells. RESULT: Gel-OCS/MBGN was successfully constructed and loaded with EVs, resulting in Gel-OCS/MBGN@EVs. The in vitro drug release experiment results show that Gel-OCS/MBGN could sustainably release EVs. Further experiments have shown that Gel-OCS/MBGN@EVs could significantly promote the differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts. Experiments have shown that WWP1 is a key factor in osteogenic differentiation and is regulated by miR-19b-3p. EVs promote osteogenic differentiation by suppressing WWP1 expression through the transmission of miR-19b-3p. In vivo animal experiments have demonstrated that Gel-OCS/MBGN@EVs significantly promote bone repair in rats with bone defects by regulating the miR-19b-3p/WWP1 signaling axis. CONCLUSION: Functional Gel-OCS/MBGN@EVs were obtained by constructing Gel-OCS/MBGN and loading EVs onto it. EVs could deliver miR-19b-3p to BMSCs, inhibit the expression of WWP1, and promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, ultimately promoting bone regeneration in rats with bone defects.","2023-11-30","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","459","","1","21","","J Nanobiotechnology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38037135 PMCID: PMC10691144","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38037135","","Animals; Biomimetic composite hydrogel; Biomimetics; BMSCs; Bone defect repair; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Hydrogels; MicroRNAs; miR-19b-3p; Osteogenesis; Osteogenic differentiation; Rat model; Rats; WWP1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, human periodontal ligament stem cell (PDLSC)-derived sEVs (P-EVs) were immobilized in Matrigel to establish a topical cell-free transplantation strategy for bone repair. METHODS: PDLSCs were cultured and P-EVs were isolated from the culture supernatant. In a rat bilateral calvarial defect model, P-EV/Matrigel was plugged into one defect and PBS/Matrigel was applied to the other. Bone repair in vivo was assessed by micro-computed tomography, histomorphometry, and immunohistochemical staining. In vitro, we investigated the effects of P-EVs on the proliferation and migration capabilities of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) and explored the potential mechanism of action. RESULTS: The in vivo study showed that P-EV/Matrigel accelerated bone tissue repair by increasing cell infiltration when compared with the control. In vitro, P-EVs enhanced proliferation and migration of BMMSCs via increased phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). The role of P-EV-induced adenosine receptor signaling in AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was a key mediator during enhanced BMMSC migration. CONCLUSION: These results are the first to demonstrate that P-EVs accelerated the repair of bone defects, partially through promoting cell proliferation and migration.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs)-mediated acellular tissue regeneration is a promising alternative to stem cell based transplants. Although neural EGFL-like 1 (Nell1) is known to contribute to the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), it remains unknown whether EVs are involved in this process. Here, we present that EVs derived from Nell1-modified BMSCs (Nell1/EVs) have a stronger ability to promote BMSC osteogenesis owing to miR-25-5p downregulation. MiR-25-5p inhibits osteogenesis by targeting Smad2 and suppressing the SMAD and extracellular signal-related kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathway activation. In addition, we demonstrate that the 3D-Nell1/EV-hydrogel system is beneficial for bone regeneration in vivo, probably stemming from a slow, continuous release and high concentration of EVs in the bone defect area. Thus, our results have shown the potential of Nell1/EVs as a novel acellular bone regeneration strategy.

However, the lack of standard procedures and controls leads to high variability in the obtained results, limiting their regular clinical use. Here, we propose the use of platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as an off-the-shelf alternative for PRP and PL for bone regeneration. In this article, we evaluate the effect of PL-derived EVs on the biocompatibility and differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). METHODS: EVs were obtained first by ultracentrifugation (UC) and then by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) from non-activated PL. EVs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and the expression of CD9 and CD63 markers by western blot. The effect of the obtained EVs on osteoinduction was evaluated in vitro on human umbilical cord MSCs by messenger RNA (mRNA) expression analysis of bone markers, alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), and calcium (Ca2+) content. RESULTS: Osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was confirmed when treated with UC-isolated EVs. In order to disprove that the effect was due to co-isolated proteins, EVs were isolated by SEC. Purer EVs were obtained and proved to maintain the differentiation effect on MSCs and showed a dose-dependent response. CONCLUSION: PL-derived EVs present an osteogenic capability comparable to PL treatments, emerging as an alternative able to overcome PL and PRP limitations.Cite this article: Bone Joint Res 2020;9(10):667-674.","2020-10","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","667-674","","10","9","","Bone Joint Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33101656 PMCID: PMC7563034","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33101656","","Extracellular vesicles; Mesenchymal stromal cells; Platelet lysate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paucity of simple, activatable, biologically relevant models of osteoclast-osteoblast coordination has hindered our understanding of how skeletal remolding is regulated. Here, we describe an inducible ex vivo model of osteoclast-osteoblast progenitor coordination. Induction activates the release of osteoclastogenic factors from osteoprogenitors, which elicits the differentiation and fusion of neighboring preosteoclasts. In turn, multinucleated osteoclasts release soluble coupling factors, RANK+ extracellular vesicles and promote osteoprogenitor proliferation, recapitulating aspects of perturbed coordination in diseases underpinned by excessive osteoclast formation. We expect this model to expedite the investigation of cell-cell fusion, osteoclast-osteoblast progenitor coordination, and extracellular vesicle signaling during bone remodeling and offer a powerful tool for evaluating signaling cascades and novel therapeutic interventions in osteoclast-linked skeletal disease.","2023-04-21","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","106470","","4","26","","iScience","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37091244 PMCID: PMC10119607","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37091244","","Biological sciences; Cell biology; Stem cells research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There has been much interest in the use of three-dimensional (3D) engineered scaffolds (PLA) complexed with human gingival mesenchymal stem cells (hGMSCs) as a new therapeutic strategy to improve bone tissue regeneration. These devices can mimic a more favorable endogenous microenvironment for cells in vivo by providing 3D substrates which are able to support cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. The present study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo capability of bone defect regeneration of 3D PLA, hGMSCs, extracellular vesicles (EVs), or polyethyleneimine (PEI)-engineered EVs (PEI-EVs) in the following experimental groups: 3D-PLA, 3D-PLA + hGMSCs, 3D-PLA + EVs, 3D-PLA + EVs + hGMSCs, 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs, 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs. METHODS: The structural parameters of the scaffold were evaluated using both scanning electron microscopy and nondestructive microcomputed tomography. Nanotopographic surface features were investigated by means of atomic force microscopy. Scaffolds showed a statistically significant mass loss along the 112-day evaluation. RESULTS: Our in vitro results revealed that both 3D-PLA + EVs + hGMSCs and 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs showed no cytotoxicity. However, 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs exhibited greater osteogenic inductivity as revealed by morphological evaluation and transcriptomic analysis performed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). In addition, in vivo results showed that 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs and 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs scaffolds implanted in rats subjected to cortical calvaria bone tissue damage were able to improve bone healing by showing better osteogenic properties. These results were supported also by computed tomography evaluation that revealed the repair of bone calvaria damage.

The characteristics and function of exosomes are affected by the bidirectional communication of their original cells and the local microenvironment in which the cells reside (e.g., the stem cell niche). However, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are customarily cultured in a traditional two-dimensional monolayer, with mechanical microenvironments varying substantially in physiological one. Few reports have addressed the effects of the 3D microenvironment on exosomal osteoinductivity. Herein, a 3D culture model is engineered through collagen hydrogel. Exosomes derived from three-dimensional culture (3D-Exos) and the conventional monolayer culture (2D-Exos) are collected and compared. The 3D culture resulted in high yield exosomes and greatly improved the efficiency of exosomes collection. The in vitro results demonstrated that the 3D-Exos induced significant promotions in osteogenic gene and protein expression (e.g., Runx2, OCN, OPN, COL1A1, and ALP), proliferation, and migration of Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and inhibited hBMSCs apoptosis. Importantly, mechanistic studies revealed that the upregulation of the YAP signaling pathway is the underlying mechanism. Moreover, the 3D-Exos resulted in enhanced new bone formation and Runx2/OPN activation in rats with alveolar bone defects. These findings proposed a novel idea of the 3D culture strategy used to enhance the osteoinductivity of MSC-derived exosomes.

Magnesium and its alloys are promising biodegradable bone implant materials and can affect immunoregulation of macrophages by the degradation products (magnesium ions). Nevertheless, the mechanism of macrophage-derived exosomes stimulated by Mg ions in immunoregulation is still not well understood. Herein, 10-50 mM magnesium ions are shown to inhibit the macrophage viability and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, but a high concentration results in macrophage apoptosis. The exosomes secreted by macrophages from magnesium ion stimulation inhibit angiogenesis of endothelial cells, as manifested by the suppressed cell viability, proliferation, migration, and tube formation, which arise at least partially from exosome-mediated downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide and the vascular endothelial growth factor. The findings reported in this paper suggest that the bio-functionality of biodegradable magnesium alloys must be considered from the perspective of immunoregulation of macrophage-derived exosomes. Our results also suggest potential cancer therapy by inhibiting tumor-associated angiogenesis.","2022-05-13","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","","","4","17","","Biomed Mater","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35477160","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35477160","","Alloys; angiogenesis; Cell Proliferation; Endothelial Cells; exosomes; Exosomes; Humans; immunoregulation; Ions; macrophages; Macrophages; magnesium; Magnesium; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we aimed to pinpoint the role of CGRP in the osteogenic differentiation property of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) and the resultant repair of alveolar bone defect. The key factor related to the osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs was retrieved from the GEO database. After extraction from hADSCs (hADSC-EVs) and identification, EVs were subjected to coculture with hPDLSCs, in which the expression patterns of CGRP and osteogenic differentiation marker proteins (ALP, RUNX2, and OCN), as well as ALP activity, were detected. A novel cell-free tissue-engineered bone (TEB) comprised of PLGA/pDA and hADSC-EVs was implanted into the rats with alveolar bone defects to evaluate the repair of alveolar bone defects. CGRP was enriched in hADSC-EVs. hADSCs delivered CGRP to hPDLSCs through EVs, thereby promoting the osteogenic differentiation potential of hPDLSCs. The PLGA/pDA-EV scaffold released EVs slowly, and its implantation into the rat alveolar bone defect area significantly induced bone defect repair, which was reversed by further knockdown of CGRP. In conclusion, our newly discovered cell-free system consisted of hADSC-EVs, and PLGA/pDA scaffold shows promising function in repairing alveolar bone defects.","2022","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","4815284","","","2022","","Oxid Med Cell Longev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35726333 PMCID: PMC9206573","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35726333","","Animals; Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; Osteogenesis; Rats; Stem Cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We showed that adipose tissue-derived MSC (ASC)-derived exosomes (ASC-EXO) were able to promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in HOBs; and the trophic effects of ASC-EXO on HOBs were further harnessed when ASCs were preconditioned with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) for 3 days, which mimics the acute inflammatory phase upon bone injury. In addition, we showed that Wnt-3a content was elevated in ASC-EXO when ASCs were preconditioned by TNF-α, and inhibiting Wnt signaling decreased the osteogenic gene expression levels in HOBs which were cultured in TNF-α preconditioned ASCs conditioned medium.

The mechanisms underlying this disorder have not been deeply investigated. Due to its rarity, no guidelines are currently available for treatment and management of GSD. We recently evaluated the cellular alterations of the bone remodeling in patients showing that osteoclast precursors displayed increased ability to differentiate into osteoclasts and that affected osteoclasts resorb bone more actively than control cells. Moreover, osteoblasts isolated from a patient showed a defective ability to form mineralized nodules. In this paper, we investigated the molecular pathways involved in the cellular defects of GSD bone cells. For this study, we recruited nine patients and performed miRNome analysis of bone cells. Between the 178 miRNAs robustly expressed in GSD osteoclasts, significant modulation of three miRNAs (miR-1246, miR-1-3p, and miR-137-3p) involved in the regulation of osteoclast formation and activity or in the angiomatous proliferation was found in patients' cells. Interestingly, miR-1246 was also up-regulated in serum exosomes from patients. Analysis of miRNAs from patient osteoblasts suggested alteration of miR-204a-5p, miR-615-3p and miR-378a-3p regulating osteoblast function and differentiation.

However, the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-EVs for meniscus regeneration is uncertain, and the mechanisms underlying MSC-EV-mediated tissue regeneration have not been fully elucidated. The aims of this study were to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of intra-articular MSC-EV injection in a meniscus defect model and elucidate the mechanism underlying MSC-EV-mediated tissue regeneration via combined bioinformatic analyses. METHODS: MSC-EVs were isolated from human synovial MSC culture supernatants via ultrafiltration. To evaluate the meniscus regeneration ability, MSC-EVs were injected intra-articularly in the mouse meniscus defect model immediately after meniscus resection and weekly thereafter. After 1 and 3 weeks, their knees were excised for histological and immunohistochemical evaluations. To investigate the mechanisms through which MSC-EVs accelerate meniscus regeneration, cell growth, migration, and chondrogenesis assays were performed using treated and untreated chondrocytes and synovial MSCs with or without MSC-EVs. RNA sequencing assessed the gene expression profile of chondrocytes stimulated by MSC-EVs. Antagonists of the human chemokine CXCR2 receptor (SB265610) were used to determine the role of CXCR2 on chondrocyte cell growth and migration induced by MSC-EVs. RESULTS: In the meniscus defect model, MSC-EV injection accelerated meniscus regeneration and normalized the morphology and composition of the repaired tissue. MSC-EVs stimulated chondrocyte and synovial MSC cell growth and migration. RNA sequencing revealed that MSC-EVs induced 168 differentially expressed genes in the chondrocytes and significantly upregulated CXCL5 and CXCL6 in chondrocytes and synovial MSCs. Suppression of CXCL5 and CXCL6 and antagonism of the CXCR2 receptor binding CXCL5 and CXCL6 negated the influence of MSC-EVs on chondrocyte cell growth and migration. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-articular MSC-EV administration repaired meniscus defects and augmented chondrocyte and synovial MSC cell growth and migration. Comprehensive transcriptome/RNA sequencing data confirmed that MSC-EVs upregulated CXCL5 and CXCL6 in chondrocytes and mediated the cell growth and migration of these cells via the CXCR2 axis.","2021-07-22","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","414","","1","12","","Stem Cell Res Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34294118 PMCID: PMC8296733","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34294118","","Cell Proliferation; CXCR2; Extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Meniscus; Meniscus regeneration; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mesenchymal stromal cell; Receptors, Interleukin-8B; RNA sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These extracellular vesicles are involved in the contribution of exosomal proteins to osteoblastic or osteoclastic regulatory networks during the failure of bone remodeling, which results in age-related bone loss. However, the molecular changes in serum-derived exosomes (SDEs) from aged patients with low bone density and their functions in bone remodeling remain to be fully elucidated. We present a quantitative proteomics analysis of exosomes purified from the serum of the elderly patients with osteoporosis/osteopenia and normal volunteers; these data are available via Proteome Xchange with the identifier PXD006463. Overall, 1,371 proteins were identified with an overlap of 1,160 Gene IDs among the ExoCarta proteins. Bioinformatics analysis and in vitro studies suggested that protein changes in SDEs of osteoporosis patients are not only involved in suppressing the integrin-mediated mechanosensation and activation of osteoblastic cells, but also trigger the differentiation and resorption of osteoclasts. In contrast, the main changes in SDEs of osteopenia patients facilitated both activation of osteoclasts and formation of new bone mass, which could result in a compensatory elevation in bone remodeling. While the SDEs from aged normal volunteers might play a protective role in bone health through facilitating adhesion of bone cells and suppressing aging-associated oxidative stress. This information will be helpful in elucidating the pathophysiological functions of SDEs and aid in the development of senile osteoporosis diagnostics and therapeutics.","2018-06","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","e12758","","3","17","","Aging Cell","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29603567 PMCID: PMC5946082","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29603567","","Aged; Bone Diseases, Metabolic; bone remodeling; Bone Remodeling; exosome; Exosomes; Humans; osteoblasts; osteoclasts; Osteoclasts; osteoporosis; Osteoporosis; Proteins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SHED-derived exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation. The impacts of SHED-derived exosomes on the angiogenic ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the osteogenic capability of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were evaluated in vitro. Compound C, a pharmacological blocker of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), was used to examine the role of the AMPK signaling cascade in these processes. Periodontal defect rat models were established and treated with PBS, β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), or a grouping of exosomes/β-TCP. Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) scanning, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, Masson staining, and immunofluorescence staining were done to inspect the impacts of the exosomes/β-TCP combination on periodontal bone regeneration. Our outcomes indicated that the expression of angiogenesis-related genes (KDR, SDF-1, and FGF2), osteogenesis-related genes (COL1, RUNX2, and OPN), and phosphorylated (p)-AMPK were upregulated after treatment with exosomes, while the positive impacts of SHED-derived exosomes on HUVECs and BMSCs were partially reversed by compound C. Micro-CT analysis demonstrated that the exosomes/β-TCP group exhibited better bone regeneration than either the β-TCP group or the control group. Additionally, the results of HE and Masson staining as well as immunofluorescence staining showed neovascularization and new bone formation in the exosomes/β-TCP group but only limited new bone formation in the other two groups. Thus, SHED-derived exosomes contribute to periodontal bone regeneration by promoting neovascularization and new bone formation, possibly through the AMPK signaling pathway.","2019-07-08","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","3561-3571","","7","5","","ACS Biomater Sci Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33405738","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33405738","","angiogenesis; bone regeneration; exosomes; osteogenesis; periodontal defect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A cell line derived from the periodontal ligament and showing all the characteristics of MSC was successfully isolated and characterized. The addition of PDLSC-CM to Saos-2 cells led to an enhancement of their proliferation and an increased expression of some osteoblastic differentiation markers, but this differentiation was not complete. Saos-2 cells were involved in the initial inflammation process by releasing IL-6 and activating COX2.

Thus, we isolated and characterized extracellular vesicles (EVs) from human adipose tissue-derived MSCs (hMSCs) and investigated their inhibitory effects on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. Purified EVs were collected from the supernatant of hMSCs by tangential flow filtration. Characterization of EVs included typical evaluation of the size and concentration of EVs by nanoparticle tracking analysis and morphology analysis using transmission electron microscopy. hMSC-EVs inhibited RANKL-induced differentiation of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) into osteoclasts in a dose-dependent manner. F-actin ring formation and bone resorption were also reduced by EV treatment of osteoclasts. In addition, EVs decreased RANKL-induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK and expression of osteoclastogenesis-related genes in BMDMs treated with RANKL. To elucidate which part of the hMSC-EVs plays a role in the inhibition of osteoclast differentiation, we analyzed miRNA profiles in hMSC-EVs. The results showed that has-miR122-5p was present at significantly high read counts. Overexpression of miR122-5p in BMDMs significantly inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and induced defects in F-actin ring formation and bone resorption. Our results also revealed that RANKL-induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK and osteoclast-specific gene expression was decreased by miR122-5p transfection, which was consistent with the results of hMSC-EVs. These findings suggest that hMSC-EVs containing miR122-5p inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation via the downregulation of molecular mechanisms and could be a preventive candidate for destructive bone diseases.","2023-11-29","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","","","","","","Biochem Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38017286","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38017286","","Extracellular vesicles; Mesenchymal stem cells; miR122-5p; Osteoclast","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exosomes have been reported in almost all biological fluids and during the failure of bone remodeling. 20 ml of blood samples were obtained from osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic postmenopausal women. After the isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), T cells were separated via the magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) technique. Exosomes were driven from T cells of non-osteoporotic and osteoporotic volunteers. Subsequently, normal osteoblasts were treated with obtained T cell exosomes to assess osteoblastic function and gene expression. RESULTS: Runx2, type I collagen, osteopontin, and osteocalcin expression decreased in osteoblasts treated by osteoporotic T cell exosomes. In contrast, an increased expression of the mentioned genes was observed following non-osteoporotic T cell exosome treatment. Additionally, osteoblast alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity treated with non-osteoporotic T cell exosomes increased. However, this activity decreased in another group. Our data demonstrated that T cell exosomes obtained from osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic individuals could alter the osteoblastic function and gene expression by affecting the genes essential for bone remodeling.","2022-08-08","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","272","","1","15","","BMC Res Notes","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35941659 PMCID: PMC9358836","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35941659","","Alkaline phosphatase; Alkaline Phosphatase; Bone Remodeling; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Exosomes; Female; Humans; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Osteoblasts; Osteocalcin; Osteoimmunology; Osteopontin; Osteoporosis; T-Lymphocytes; Type I collagen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The balance between osteogenesis and adipogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) plays a major role in the process of bone formation. Recently, intercellular communication between bone cells and surrounding cells has been gradually recognized, and macrophages on the surface of bone have been proven to regulate bone metabolism. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Recent studies have indicated that exosomes are vital messengers for cell-cell communication in various biological processes. In this experiment, we found that exosomes derived from M2 macrophages (M2D-Exos) could inhibit adipogenesis and promote osteogenesis of BMSCs. M2D-Exo intervention increased the expression of miR-690, IRS-1, and TAZ in BMSCs. Additionally, miR-690 knockdown in M2 macrophages with a miR-690 inhibitor partially counteracted the effect of M2D-Exos on BMSC differentiation and the upregulation of IRS-1 and TAZ expression. Taken together, the results of our study indicate that exosomes isolated from M2 macrophages could facilitate osteogenesis and reduce adipogenesis through the miR-690/IRS-1/TAZ axis and might be a therapeutic tool for bone loss diseases.","2021","2024-01-26 18:47:20","2024-01-26 18:47:20","","680328","","","12","","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34295306 PMCID: PMC8290518","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34295306","","adipogenesis; Adipogenesis; Animals; bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell; exosomes; Exosomes; Interleukin-4; macrophage; Macrophages; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; osteogenesis; Osteogenesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies have reported the use of EVs to stimulate tissue regeneration, such as hepatic cell regeneration, and to treat diseases, such as pulmonary hypertension. However, little is known about the osteogenic effect of EVs. In this study, we explore the role of bone marrow stromal cell-derived EVs in the regulation of osteoblast activity and bone regeneration. We isolated bone marrow stromal/stem cell (BMSC)-derived EVs through gradient ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration, and tested the influence of the EVs on osteogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. The results indicated that EVs positively regulated osteogenic genes and osteoblastic differentiation but did not inhibit proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, we constructed an EVs delivery system to stimulate bone formation in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats with calvarial defects. We found that BMSC-derived EVs led to more bone formation in the critical-size calvarial bone defects. Moreover, we found that miR-196a plays an essential role in the regulation of osteoblastic differentiation and the expression of osteogenic genes. We anticipate that our assay using bone marrow stromal cell-derived EVs will become a valuable tool for promoting bone regeneration.","2016-02-25","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","21961","","","6","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26911789 PMCID: PMC4766421","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\4E4FJEBA\Qin et al. - 2016 - Bone marrow stromalstem cell-derived extracellula.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26911789","","Animals; Bone and Bones; Bone Marrow Cells; Bone Regeneration; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Extracellular Vesicles; Flow Cytometry; Golgi Apparatus; Humans; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; MicroRNAs; Microscopy, Confocal; Microscopy, Electron; Osteoblasts; Osteocalcin; Osteogenesis; Osteopontin; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; X-Ray Microtomography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several approaches can be made to treat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, including the use of stem cells. However, the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells depends on its released factors, including extracellular vesicles. Extracellular vesicles have been recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication as they participate in many physiological processes. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells derived extracellular vesicles on the structure of alveolar bone in rats with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. METHODS: Thirty adult albino male rats were divided into 3 groups: control group (CG), glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GOG) and extracellular vesicles treated group (ExTG). Rats in the GOG and ExTG groups were injected with methylprednisolone acetate (40 mg/kg) intramuscularly in the quadriceps muscle 3 times per week for three weeks in the early morning. Afterwards, the rats in GOG group received a single vehicle injection (PBS) while each rat in the ExTG group received a single injection of extracellular vesicles (400 μg/kg suspended in 0.2 ml PBS) in the tail vein. Rats were euthanized 1 month after injection. Mandibles were dissected and the molar segments were prepared for histological preparation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX). RESULTS: Histology and scanning electron microscopyof bone tissue showed alveolar bone loss and bone resorption in the GOG group. while in the ExTG group, alveolar bone demostrated normal bone architecture. EDX showed that calcium percentage in GOG group was lower than ExTG group,which showed no statistically significant difference from the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Extracellular vesicles may be a promising treatment modality in the treatment of bone diseases and in bone regeneration. However, further research is needed before stating that extracellular vesicles s can be used to treat bone disorders especially when translating to humans.","2023-03-17","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","205","","1","24","","BMC Musculoskelet Disord","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36932362 PMCID: PMC10022145","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\ZN5G8YGS\Sedik et al. - 2023 - Biological effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36932362","","Animals; Bone and Bones; Extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Mesenchymal stem cells; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Osteoporosis; Rats","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EVs released from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-EVs) have the potential to treat multiple diseases. This study aimed to determine the effects of MSC-EVs on bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ), whose pathogenesis and treatment are not yet established. To this end, zoledronic acid (ZOL) was administered to bone marrow cells and fibroblasts in vitro. In vivo, a BRONJ model was produced by administering ZOL to rats and extracting teeth. Each MSC-EV-treated and nontreated group was compared histologically and molecularly. In vitro, the nontreated group showed an increased number of β-galactosidase-positive cells and expression of senescence-associated genes p21, pRB and senescence-related inflammatory cytokines. Conversely, MSC-EV administration decreased the number of senescent cells and expression levels of p21, pRB and inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, in the nontreated group, the socket was partially uncovered by the oral epithelium, leaving an exposed bone. Conversely, in the MSC-EV-treated group, the socket was healed. Besides, in the nontreated group, β-galactosidase-positive cells existed in the socket and colocalized with the CD90 and periostin-positive cells. However, there were few β-galactosidase-positive cells in the MSC-EV-treated group. Furthermore, gene expression of stem cell markers Bmi1 and Hmga2 and the vascular endothelial marker VEGF was significantly increased in the MSC-EV-treated group, compared with that in the nontreated group. These results indicate that MSC-EVs prevent ZOL-induced senescence in stem cells, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts and reduce inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, administration of MSC-EVs prevented senescence of cells involved in wound healing and the spread of chronic inflammation around senescent cells, thereby promoting angiogenesis and bone regeneration and preventing BRONJ.","2020-05","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","552-560","","5","99","","J Dent Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32119600","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32119600","","Animals; bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw; Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw; cellular senescence; Disease Models, Animal; exosomes; Extracellular Vesicles; mesenchymal stem cells; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Rats; wound healing; zoledronic acid; Zoledronic Acid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we aimed to synthesize a new type of coralline hydroxyapatite (CHA)/silk fibroin (SF)/glycol chitosan (GCS)/difunctionalized polyethylene glycol (DF-PEG) self-healing hydrogel and to evaluate the therapeutic effects of this novel self-healing hydrogel as a human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSC)-derived exosome carrier on bone defects in SD rat. METHODS: HucMSCs were isolated from fetal umbilical cord tissue and characterized by surface antigen analysis and pluripotent differentiation in vitro. The cell supernatant after ultracentrifugation was collected to isolate exosomes, which were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and western blot analysis. In vitro cell induction experiments were performed to observe the effects of hucMSC-derived exosomes on the biological behavior of mouse osteoblast progenitor cells (mOPCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The CHA/SF/GCS/DF-PEG hydrogels were prepared using DF-PEG as the gel factor and then structural and physical properties were characterized. HucMSCs-derived exosomes were added to the hydrogel and their effects were evaluated in SD rats with induced femoral condyle defect. These effects were analyzed by X-ray and micro-CT imaging and H&E, Masson and immunohistochemistry staining. RESULTS: HucMSC-derived exosomes can promote osteogenic differentiation of mOPCs and promote the proliferation and migration of HUVECs. The CHA/SF/GCS/DF-PEG hydrogel has a high self-healing capacity, perfect surface morphology and the precipitated CHA crystals have a small size and low crystallinity similar to natural bone minerals. The MTT results showed that the hydrogel was non-toxic and have a good biocompatibility. The in vivo studies have shown that the hydrogel containing exosomes could effectively promote healing of rat bone defect. The histological analysis revealed more new bone tissue and morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) in the hydrogel-exosome group. In addition, the hydrogel-exosome group had the highest microvessel density. CONCLUSION: A self-healing CHA/SF/GCS/DF-PEG hydrogel was successfully prepared. The hydrogel has excellent comprehensive properties and is expected to become a new type of bone graft material. This hydrogel has the effect of promoting bone repair, which is more significant after the addition of hucMSC-derived exosomes.","2020","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","564731","","","8","","Front Bioeng Biotechnol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33042966 PMCID: PMC7521201","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\4BFC634N\Wang et al. - 2020 - A New Self-Healing Hydrogel Containing hucMSC-Deri.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042966","","bone graft material; bone regeneration; exosomes; human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells; self-healing hydrogel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exosomes were isolated and quantified from Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated primary hPDLFs and evaluated by western blotting, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. GW4869 was used to block exosome secretion in conditioned medium (CM). hPDLFs-derived CM, CM containing GW4869 (CM + GW4869) and exosomes were used to stimulate MG-63 cell lines. The expression levels of proinflammatory mediators, osteogenic genes, and osteoclastogenesis-related genes were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, and alkaline phosphatase staining. RESULTS: Exosome-enriched protein and total exosomal protein levels were higher in the LPS-treated group than in the vehicle controls. hPDLFs-derived exosomes were incorporated into MG-63 osteoblasts and slightly upregulated the expression of Interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CM and exosomes inhibited alkaline phosphatase, Collagen-I, Runt-related transcription factor 2, and Osteoprotegerin expression as well as ALP activity, and blocking exosome secretion by GW4869 eliminated the inhibitory effects.

Our previous research demonstrated that BMSCs-ExoTGF-β1 attenuated cartilage damage in osteoarthritis (OA) rats through carrying highly expressed miR-135b. METHODS: The bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were isolated from mouse bone marrow, and BMSC-derived exosomes (BMSCs-Exo) were isolated from BMSCs.

RESULTS: BMSCs-ExoTGF-β1 attenuated cartilage damage in OA mice in vivo by ameliorating articular cartilage degeneration and suppressing calcification of the cartilage zone. BMSCs-ExoTGF-β1 also inhibited osteoclastogenesis by suppressing the MAPK pathway in vitro. Micro-computed tomography indicated that BMSCs-ExoTGF-β1 impeded uncoupled subchondral bone remodeling.

Given the limitations of current stem cell therapy approaches, improvements in immunomodulatory capacity and stem cell differentiation efficacy are needed. In this study, we propose novel strategies to overcome the challenges that remain in hMSC-mediated bone regeneration. We found that PD-1 is highly expressed in osteoblasts, and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis mediated the decreased proinflammatory cytokine expressions in differentiated osteoblasts cocultured with human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs). Moreover, the decrease was attenuated by PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibition. Osteogenic properties including osteogenic gene expression and calcium deposits were increased in osteoblasts cocultured with hADMSCs compared with those that were monocultured. Osteoblasts treated with PD-L1 and exosomes from hADMSCs also exhibited enhanced osteogenic properties, including calcium deposits and osteogenic gene expression. In our cocultured system that mimics the physiological conditions of the bone matrix, the PD-1/PD-L1 axis mediated the increased expression of osteogenic genes, thereby enhancing the osteogenic properties, while the calcium deposits of osteoblasts were maintained. Our results provide the therapeutic potentials and novel roles of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in bone matrix for modulating the bone properties and immunosuppressive potentials that can aid in the prevention of bone diseases via maintaining bone homeostasis.","2022-10-07","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","3152","","19","11","","Cells","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36231113 PMCID: PMC9564087","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\XBCPCLNF\Lee et al. - 2022 - Immunomodulatory Effect and Bone Homeostasis Regul.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36231113","","B7-H1 Antigen; bone homeostasis; bone regeneration; Calcium; Cell Differentiation; Cytokines; hADMSCs; Homeostasis; Humans; Ligands; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; osteoblasts; Osteoblasts; PD-1/PD-L1 axis; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effect of BMSC-derived EVs loaded with miR-15b on osteogenic differentiation. METHODS: Human BMSCs (hBMSCs) were cultured and treated with plasmids overexpressing or knocking down KLF2, WWP1, and miR-15b to define the role of derived EVs in osteogenic differentiation in vitro. The expression of osteogenic differentiation-related marker was measured by Western blot analysis. The interaction among miR-15b, WWP1, and ubiquitination of KLF2 was investigated by dual-luciferase reporter, immunoprecipitation, and GST pull-down assays. Moreover, EVs from hBMSCs transfected with miR-15b inhibitor (EV-miR-15b inhibitor) were injected into ovariectomized rats to verify the effect of miR-15b on bone loss in vivo. RESULTS: WWP1 was downregulated, and KLF2 was upregulated during osteogenic differentiation. After co-culture with EVs, miR-15b expression was elevated and WWP1 expression was reduced in hBMSCs. Upregulation of miR-15b or KLF2 or downregulation of WWP1 or NF-κB increased ALP activity and cell mineralization, as well as osteogenic differentiation-related marker expression in hBMSCs. Mechanistically, miR-15b targeted and inhibited WWP1, thus attenuating KLF2 degradation and inhibiting NF-κB activity. Co-culture of EVs increased the bone volume and trabecular number, but decreased bone loss in ovariectomized rats, which could be reversed after treatment with EV-miR-15b inhibitor.

This results in a heavily vascularized tissue where endothelial cells and skeletal cells are constantly in crosstalk to facilitate homeostasis, a process that is mediated by numerous environmental signals, including mechanical loading. Breakdown in this communication can lead to disease and/or poor fracture repair. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the role of mature bone cells in regulating angiogenesis, how this is influenced by a dynamic mechanical environment, and understand the mechanism by which this could occur. Herein, we demonstrate that both osteoblasts and osteocytes coordinate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and blood vessel formation via a mechanically dependent paracrine mechanism. Moreover, we identified that this process is mediated via the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), as isolated EVs from mechanically stimulated bone cells elicited the same response as seen with the full secretome, while the EV-depleted secretome did not elicit any effect. Despite mechanically activated bone cell-derived EVs (MA-EVs) driving a similar response to VEGF treatment, MA-EVs contain minimal quantities of this angiogenic factor. Lastly, a miRNA screen identified mechanoresponsive miRNAs packaged within MA-EVs which are linked with angiogenesis. Taken together, this study has highlighted an important mechanism in osteogenic-angiogenic coupling in bone and has identified the mechanically activated bone cell-derived EVs as a therapeutic to promote angiogenesis and potentially bone repair.","2023","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","20417314231186918","","","14","","J Tissue Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37654438 PMCID: PMC10467237","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\AQUKMUM9\Shen et al. - 2023 - Mechanically activated mesenchymal-derived bone ce.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37654438","","angiogenesis; mechanobiology; miRNA; miRNA-150-5p; Osteoblast; osteocyte; VEGF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such materials are also bio-inert, which does not match the elastic modulus of bone. Therefore, different surface modifications have been proposed for clinical application. Based on the use of traditional titanium alloy in the field of bone repair defects, we prepared a compound Gr-Ti scaffold with ADSC-derived Exos. The results showed that Gr-Ti scaffolds have low toxicity and good biocompatibility, which can promote the adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs. Exos played a role in promoting osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs: the mRNA levels of RUNX2, ALP, and Osterix in the Gr-Ti/Exos group were significantly higher than those in the Gr-Ti group, which process related to the Wnt signaling pathway. Gr-Ti scaffolds with ADSCs and ADSC-derived Exos successfully repaired rabbit mandibular defects.

The constructed SrTi Sc can serve as a sophisticated biomaterial platform for maintaining bone morphological characteristics of the radius during the period of critical bone defect (CBD) repair and further accelerating bone formation and fibroblastic suppression via the controlled release of Sr from the superficial layer of the scaffold. Moreover, compared with sEXO from healthy donors, the sEXO extracted from the serum of the femoral fracture rabbit model at the stage of fracture healing, named BF EXO, is robustly capable of facilitating osteogenesis and angiogenesis. In addition, the underlying therapeutic mechanism is elucidated, whereby altering miRNAs shuttled by BF EXO enables osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Further, the in vivo study revealed that the SrTi Sc + BF EXO composite dramatically accelerated bone repair via osteoconduction, osteoinduction, and revascularization in radial CBD of rabbits.

In fact, several in vitro studies have already demonstrated the efficacy of Extracellular Vesicles (EV) in promoting bone regeneration and repair in various orthopedic models. Therefore, to evaluate the translational potential in this field, an in vivo study was performed. METHODS: Here, we used hyaluronic acid (HA) gels formulated with pEVs, as a way to directly apply pEVs and retain them at the bone defect. In this study, pEVs were isolated from Platelet Lysate (PL) through size exclusion chromatography and used to formulate 2% HA gels. Then, the gels were locally applied on the tibia cortical bone defect of New Zeland White rabbits before the surgical implantation of coin-shaped titanium implants. After eight weeks, the bone healing process was analyzed through biomechanical, micro-CT, histological and biochemical analysis. RESULTS: Although no biomechanical differences were observed between pEV formulated gels and non-formulated gels, biochemical markers of the wound fluid at the interface presented a decrease in Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity for pEV HA treated implants. Moreover, histological analyses showed that none of the treatments induced an irritative effect and, a decrease in the fibrotic response surrounding the implant for pEV HA treated implants was described. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, pEVs improve titanium implants biocompatibility at the bone-implant interface, decreasing the necrotic effects of the surgery and diminishing the fibrotic layer associated to the implant encapsulation that can lead to implant failure.","2023-05","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","72-79","","","40","","J Orthop Translat","Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles formulated with hyaluronic acid gels for application at the bone-implant interface","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37457308 PMCID: PMC10338901","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\5FFRHKML\Antich-Rosselló et al. - 2023 - Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles formulated.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37457308","","Bone regeneration; Extracellular vesicles; Hyaluronic acid; Platelets; Titanium implants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The intensity of alveolar bone resorption greatly enhances the chances of observing images of the extremely rapid events of apoptosis of bone cells and also of images of interactions between osteoclasts and osteocytes/osteoblasts/bone lining cells. To find such images, we have therefore examined the alveolar bone of young rats using light microscopy, the TUNEL method for apoptosis, and electron microscopy. Fragments of alveolar bone from young rats were fixed in Bouin and formaldehyde for morphology and for the TUNEL method. Glutaraldehyde-formaldehyde fixed specimens were processed for transmission electron microscopy. Results showed TUNEL positive round/ovoid structures on the bone surface and inside osteocytic lacunae. These structures--also stained by hematoxylin--were therefore interpreted, respectively, as osteoblasts/lining cells and osteocytes undergoing apoptosis. Osteoclasts also exhibited TUNEL positive apoptotic bodies inside large vacuoles; the nuclei of osteoclasts, however, were always TUNEL negative. Ultrathin sections revealed typical apoptotic images--round/ ovoid bodies with dense crescent-like chromatin--on the bone surface, corresponding therefore to apoptotic osteoblasts/lining cells. Osteocytes also showed images compatible with apoptosis. Large osteoclast vacuoles often contained fragmented cellular material. Our results provide further support for the idea that osteoclasts internalize dying bone cells; we were however, unable to find images of osteoclasts in apoptosis.","2001-08","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","318-325","","4","33","","Tissue Cell","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 11521946","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11521946","","Acid Phosphatase; Alveolar Process; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Apoptosis; Biomarkers; Bone Remodeling; Bone Resorption; Female; In Situ Nick-End Labeling; Isoenzymes; Male; Microscopy, Electron; Osteoblasts; Osteoclasts; Osteocytes; Phagocytosis; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Staining and Labeling; Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, how EVs mediate the cross-talk between PCa cells and osteoprogenitors in the bone microenvironment remains poorly understood. We found that EVs derived from murine PCa cell line RM1-BM increased metabolic activity, vitality, and cell proliferation of osteoblast precursors by >60%, while significantly impairing mineral deposition (-37%). The latter was further confirmed in two complementary in vivo models of ossification. Accordingly, gene and protein set enrichments of osteoprogenitors exposed to EVs displayed significant downregulation of osteogenic markers and upregulation of proinflammatory factors. Additionally, transcriptomic profiling of PCa-EVs revealed the abundance of three microRNAs, miR-26a-5p, miR-27a-3p, and miR-30e-5p involved in the suppression of BMP-2-induced osteogenesis in vivo, suggesting the critical role of these EV-derived miRNAs in PCa-mediated suppression of osteoblast activity.

The success of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based research strategies in improving bone regeneration was hampered not only due to the limited knowledge of therapeutic actions of MSCs but also due to difficulties as well as expenses related to cell manufacturing and time taken for ethical approvals for clinical use of living cells and engineered tissues. The recent trend indicated that there is a shift from the direct usage of MSCs toward the application of paracrine factors and extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from their MSC secretome in bone tissue regeneration. This shift has directed research into the development of ""cell-free"" therapeutics, which could be a better alternative due to its several advantages over the use of their parental MSCs. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggested that the 3D microenvironment influences the paracrine effects of MSCs. Although the osteogenic role of EVs has been explored recently, the current study showed, for the first time, that encapsulation of EVs along with MC3T3 cells in a 3D hydrogel-assisted culture with a distinct porous microenvironment having meso and macro (0.05-200 μm) pore size distribution resulted in an improved osteogenic response in vitro. The present work was primarily focused on investigating the influence of EVs isolated under distinct priming conditions to enhance the osteogenic potential. In addition, in the current work, the osteogenic ability of different types of EVs (microvesicles and exosomes) and total EVs isolated at different time points was also examined when encapsulated with MC3T3 cells in an alginate gel. Using various biochemical assays, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) production and calcium secretion, it was observed that both microvesicles and exosomes collected from MC3T3 cells independently had osteogenic potential; however, their collective activity was found to be superior. We further showed that EVs induce an early osteogenic response in MC3T3 cells as indicated by ALP and calcium secretion at a much earlier time point, compared to the controls. Our data suggested that this 3D hydrogel-assisted system provides close proximity of cells and EVs, and thus, mimics the in vivo scenario, making it clinically useful for bone tissue engineering.","2021-06-14","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","2687-2700","","6","7","","ACS Biomater Sci Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34018721","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34018721","","3D culture; Bone Regeneration; exosomes; extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; hydrogel; Hydrogels; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; microvesicles; Osteogenesis; osteoinduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A promising approach involves the utilization of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) derived exosomes. The hypothesis of this study was that these exosomes, when loaded onto a gelatin sponge, a common hemostatic material, would enhance hemostasis and accelerate wound healing. AIM: To investigate the hemostatic and wound healing efficacy of gelatin sponges loaded with hUC-MSCs-derived exosomes. METHODS: Ultracentrifugation was used to extract exosomes from hUC-MSCs. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot techniques were used to validate the exosomes. In vitro experiments were performed using L929 cells to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the exosomes and their impact on cell growth and survival. New Zealand rabbits were used for skin irritation experiments to assess whether they caused adverse skin reactions. Hemolysis test was conducted using a 2% rabbit red blood cell suspension to detect whether they caused hemolysis. Moreover, in vivo experiments were carried out by implanting a gelatin sponge loaded with exosomes subcutaneously in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to perform biocompatibility tests. In addition, coagulation index test was conducted to evaluate their impact on blood coagulation. Meanwhile, SD rat liver defect hemostasis model and full-thickness skin defect model were used to study whether the gelatin sponge loaded with exosomes effectively stopped bleeding and promoted wound healing. RESULTS: The NTA, TEM, and western blot experimental results confirmed that exosomes were successfully isolated from hUC-MSCs. The gelatin sponge loaded with exosomes did not exhibit significant cell toxicity, skin irritation, or hemolysis, and they demonstrated good compatibility in SD rats. Additionally, the effectiveness of the gelatin sponge loaded with exosomes in hemostasis and wound healing was validated. The results of the coagulation index experiment indicated that the gelatin sponge loaded with exosomes had significantly better coagulation effect compared to the regular gelatin sponge, and they showed excellent hemostatic performance in a liver defect hemostasis model. Finally, the full-thickness skin defect healing experiment results showed significant improvement in the healing process of wounds treated with the gelatin sponge loaded with exosomes compared to other groups. CONCLUSION: Collectively, the gelatin sponge loaded with hUC-MSCs-derived exosomes is safe and efficacious for promoting hemostasis and accelerating wound healing, warranting further clinical application.","2023-09-26","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","947-959","","9","15","","World J Stem Cells","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37900941 PMCID: PMC10600743","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\SIJ4LXCE\Hu et al. - 2023 - Enhanced wound healing and hemostasis with exosome.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37900941","","Exosomes; Gelatin sponge; Hemostasis; Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells; Safety; Wound healing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we fabricated an asymmetric wettable dressing with a composite of exosomes and silver nanoparticles (CTS-SF/SA/Ag-Exo dressing) for promoting angiogenesis, nerve repair and infected wound healing. The CTS-SF/SA/Ag-Exo dressing possesses multifunctional properties including broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, promoting wound healing, retaining moisture and maintaining electrolyte balance. It can effectively inhibit the growth of bacterial and promote the proliferation of human fibroblasts in vitro. Moreover, the in vivo results show that the CTS-SF/SA/Ag-Exo dressing enhanced wound healing by accelerating collagen deposition, angiogenesis and nerve repair in a P. aeruginosa infected mouse skin wound defect model.

However, the significance of osteoblast-derived extracellular vesicles on osteogenesis has not been fully established. In this present study, we aim to investigate the therapeutic potential of extracellular vesicles secreted from consecutive 14 days of dexamethasone-stimulated osteoblasts (OB-EVDex) to act as a biomimetic tool for regulating osteogenesis, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. OB-EVdex treated groups are compared to the clinically used osteo-inductor of BMP-2 as control. Our findings revealed that OB-EVDex have a typical bilayer membrane nanostructure of, with an average diameter of 178 ± 21 nm, and that fluorescently labeled OB-EVDex were engulfed by osteoblasts in a time-dependent manner. The proliferation, attachment, and viability capacities of OB-EVDex-treated osteoblasts were significantly improved when compared to untreated cells, with the highest proliferative rate observed in the OB-EVDex + BMP-2 group. Notably, combinations of OB-EVDex and BMP-2 markedly promoted osteogenic differentiation by positively upregulating osteogenesis-related gene expression levels of RUNX2, BGLAP, SPP1, SPARC, Col 1A1, and ALPL relative to BMP-2 or OB-EVDex treatment alone. Mineralization assays also showed greater pro-osteogenic potency after combined applications of OB-EVDex and BMP-2, as evidenced by a notable increase in mineralized nodules (calcium deposition) revealed by Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Alizarin Red Alizarin Red staining (ARS), and von Kossa staining. Therefore, our findings shed light on the potential of OB-EVDex as a new therapeutic option for enhancing osteogenesis.","2023","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","1160703","","","11","","Front Bioeng Biotechnol","Osteoblast derived extracellular vesicles induced by dexamethasone","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37020508 PMCID: PMC10069331","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\WHRH7JBI\Zhang et al. - 2023 - Osteoblast derived extracellular vesicles induced .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37020508","","bone regeneration; dexamethasone stimulation; extracellular vesicles; intercellular crosstalk; osteoblastic differentiation; osteogenesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it remains uncertain whether this distraction osteogenesis (DO) process induced by TS involves the pivotal coupling of angiogenesis and osteogenesis mediated by type H endothelial cells (THECs). In this study, it is demonstrated that the Ilizarov technique induces the formation of a metaphysis-like architecture composed of THECs, leading to segmental bone regeneration during the DO process. Mechanistically, cell-matrix interactions-mediated activation of yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) transcriptionally upregulates the expression of Notch1 and Delta-like ligand 4, which act as direct positive regulators of THECs phenotype, in bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs) upon TS stimulation. Simultaneously, the Notch intracellular domain enhances YAP/TAZ activity by transcriptionally upregulating YAP expression and stabilizing TAZ protein, thus establishing the YAP/TAZ-Notch circuit. Additionally, TS-stimulated BMECs secrete exosomes enriched with vital molecules in this positive feedback pathway, which can be utilized to promote segmental bone defect healing, mimicking the therapeutic effects of Ilizarov technique. The findings advance the understanding of TS-induced segmental bone regeneration and establish the foundation for innovative biological therapeutic strategies aimed at activating THECs.","2024-01-15","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","e2309133","","","","","Adv Sci (Weinh)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38225729","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38225729","","bone formation; distraction osteogenesis; endothelial cell; exosome; mechanical force","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study represents the feasibility study for the sterile production of coprinted scaffolds and the proof of concept for their in vitro biological efficacy. Sterile scaffolds were obtained, and Lyosecretome enhanced their colonization by MSCs, sustaining differentiation towards the bone line in an osteogenic medium. Indeed, after 14 days, the amount of mineralized matrix detected by alizarin red was significantly higher for the Lyosecretome scaffolds. The amount of osteocalcin, a specific bone matrix protein, was significantly higher at all the times considered (14 and 28 days) for the Lyosecretome scaffolds. Confocal microscopy further confirmed such results, demonstrating improved osteogenesis with the Lyosecretome scaffolds after 14 and 28 days.

Herein, we confirmed that VPA treatment was associated with decreased bone mass and bone mineral density (BMD) in both patients and mice. This effect was attributed to VPA-induced elevation in osteoclast formation and activity. Through RNA-sequencing, we observed a significant rise in precursor miR-6359 expression in VPA-treated osteoclast precursors in vitro, and further, a marked upregulation of mature miR-6359 (miR-6359) in vivo was demonstrated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and miR-6359 fluorescent in situ hybridization (miR-6359-FISH). Specifically, the miR-6359 was predominantly increased in osteoclast precursors and macrophages but not in neutrophils, T lymphocytes, monocytes and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) following VPA stimulation, which influenced osteoclast differentiation and bone-resorptive activity. Additionally, VPA-induced miR-6359 enrichment in osteoclast precursors enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by silencing the SIRT3 protein expression, followed by activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, which enhanced osteoclast formation and activity, thereby accelerating bone loss. Currently, there are no medications that can effectively treat VPA-induced bone loss. Therefore, we constructed engineered small extracellular vesicles (E-sEVs) targeting osteoclast precursors in bone and naturally carrying anti-miR-6359 by introducing of EXOmotif (CGGGAGC) in the 3'-end of the anti-miR-6359 sequence. We confirmed that the E-sEVs exhibited decent bone/osteoclast precursor targeting and exerted protective therapeutic effects on VPA-induced bone loss, but not on ovariectomy (OVX) and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporotic models, deepening our understanding of the underlying mechanism and treatment strategies for VPA-induced bone loss.","2024-01-22","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","24","","1","9","","Signal Transduct Target Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38246920 PMCID: PMC10800355","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\IQFK2CB4\Xie et al. - 2024 - Bone-targeting engineered small extracellular vesi.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38246920","","Animals; Antagomirs; Extracellular Vesicles; Female; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Mice; MicroRNAs; Valproic Acid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the immune regulatory properties of MSCs have become increasingly prominent, whether bm-MSCs could also play an immunomodulatory role on macrophages under the influence of Ti surface topography is unclear. To further illuminate the communications between bm-MSCs and macrophages, the bm-MSCs inoculated on Ti with nanoporous topography were indirectly co-cultured with macrophages, and by blocking exosome secretion or extracting the purified exosomes to induce independently, we bidirectionally confirmed that under the influence of TiO2 nanoporous topography with 80-100 nm tube diameters, bm-MSCs can exert immunomodulatory effects through exosome-mediated paracrine actions and induce M1 polarization of macrophages, adversely affecting the osteogenic microenvironment around the implant.

Herein, hEMSCs were cultured with osteogenic induction medium or normal medium to generate two types of EVs. We first demonstrated that the two EVs exhibited strong potential to promote rat suture mesenchymal stem cell (SMSC) osteogenesis by transferring TG2 to SMSCs and regulating extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis. Next, we developed a composite hydrogel made of porcine omentum and chitosan into which EVs were adsorbed to enable the effective delivery of EVs with sustained release kinetics. Implantation of the EV-loaded hydrogels in a critical-size rat cranial defect model significantly promoted bone regeneration.

METHODS: Critical-size osteochondral defects (4.5-mm diameter and 1.5-mm depth) were created on the trochlear grooves in the knees of 18 rabbits and were randomly allocated to 2 treatment groups: (1) exosomes and HA combination and (2) HA alone. Three 1-mL injections of either exosomes and HA or HA alone were administered intra-articularly immediately after surgery and thereafter at 7 and 14 days after surgery. At 6 and 12 weeks, gross evaluation, histologic and immunohistochemical analysis, and scoring were performed. The functional biomechanical competence of the repaired cartilage also was evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with defects treated with HA, defects treated with exosomes and HA showed significant improvements in macroscopic scores (P = .032; P = .001) and histologic scores (P = .005; P < .001) at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. Defects treated with exosomes and HA also demonstrated improvements in mechanical properties compared with HA-treated defects, with significantly greater Young's moduli (P < .05) and stiffness (P < .05) at 6 and 12 weeks. By 12 weeks, the newly-repaired tissues in defects treated with exosomes and HA composed mainly of hyaline cartilage that are mechanically and structurally superior to that of HA-treated defects and demonstrated mechanical properties that approximated that of adjacent native cartilage (P > .05). In contrast, HA-treated defects showed some repair at 6 weeks, but this was not sustained, as evidenced by significant deterioration of histologic scores (P = .002) and a plateau in mechanical properties from 6 to 12 weeks.

However, such reconstructive modalities with postsurgery radiotherapy or chemotherapy can hardly support the functional recovery of the tongue-particularly, functional taste bud regeneration-in reconstructed areas, thus seriously affecting patients' prognosis and life quality.

In addition, our results indicate that GMSCs or their derivative exosomes could increase BDNF expression, a growth factor that plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of epithelial basal progenitor cells into taste bud cells. Meanwhile, we showed an elevated expression level of Shh-which is essential for development, homeostasis, and maintenance of the taste bud organ-in wounded areas of the tongue among animals treated with GMSC/SIS-ECM or exosome/SIS-ECM as compared with SIS-ECM control. Moreover, our data show that GMSCs or their derivative exosomes promoted innervation of regenerated taste buds, as evidenced by elevated expressions of neurofilament and P2X3 at the injury areas.

Osteocytes are mechanosensitive cells that play fundamental roles in coordinating loading-induced bone formation via the secretion of paracrine factors. However, the exact mechanisms by which osteocytes relay mechanical signals to these progenitor cells are poorly understood. Therefore, this study aimed to demonstrate the potency of the mechanically stimulated osteocyte secretome in driving human bone marrow stem/stromal cell (hMSC) recruitment and differentiation, and characterize the secretome to identify potential factors regulating stem cell behavior and bone mechanobiology. We demonstrate that osteocytes subjected to fluid shear secrete a distinct collection of factors that significantly enhance hMSC recruitment and osteogenesis and demonstrate the key role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in driving these effects. This demonstrates the pro-osteogenic potential of osteocyte-derived mechanically activated extracellular vesicles, which have great potential as a cell-free therapy to enhance bone regeneration and repair in diseases such as osteoporosis.","2020-11","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","1431-1447","","11","9","","Stem Cells Transl Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32672416 PMCID: PMC7581449","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\9IEQISP9\Eichholz et al. - 2020 - Human bone marrow stemstromal cell osteogenesis i.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32672416","","Animals; bone; Bone Marrow; Cell Differentiation; extracellular vesicle; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; marrow stem cell; mechanobiology; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Osteocytes; Osteogenesis; proteomics; Proteomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to investigate miR-26a as a therapeutic cargo to be loaded into bone marrow stromal cell exosomes through a novel immunomodulatory peptide (DP7-C). METHODS: After transfecting BMSCs with DP7-C as a transfection agent, exosomes were extracted by ultracentrifugation from the culture supernatant of miR-26a-modified BMSCs. We then characterized and identified the engineered exosomes. The effect of the engineered exosomes on osteogenesis was then evaluated in vitro and in vivo, including transwell, wound healing, modified alizarin red staining, western blot, real-time quantitative PCR, and experimental periodontitis assays. Bioinformatics and data analyses were conducted to investigate the role of miR-26a in bone regeneration. RESULTS: The DP7-C/miR-26a complex successfully transfected miR-26a into BMSCs and stimulated them to release more than 300 times the amount of exosomes overexpressing miR-26a compared with the ExoNC group. Furthermore, exosomes loaded with miR-26a could enhance proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro compared with the ExoNC and blank groups. In vivo, the ExomiR-26a group inhibited the destruction of periodontitis compared with the ExoNC and blank groups, as revealed by HE staining. Micro-CT indicated that treatment of ExomiR-26a increased the percent bone volume and the bone mineral density compared with those of the ExoNC (P < 0.05) and blank groups (P < 0.001). Target gene analysis indicated that the osteogenic effect of miR-26a is related to the mTOR pathway. CONCLUSION: miR-26a can be encapsulated into exosomes through DP7-C.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The mouse tendon-bone reconstruction model was established, and the mice were randomly divided into 3 groups: the control group, the hydrogel group, and the hydrogel+exosome group, with 30 mice in each group. At 7 days, 14 days, and 1 month after surgery, tendon-bone junction samples were harvested, and the macrophage polarization and tendon-bone healing were evaluated based on histology, immunofluorescence, and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. RESULTS In the early phase, we observed significantly higher numbers of M2 macrophages and more anti-inflammatory and chondrogenic-related factors in the hydrogel+BMSC-Exos group compared with the control group and the hydrogel group. The M1 macrophages and related proinflammatory factors decreased. Cell apoptosis decreased in the hydrogel+BMSC-Exos group, while cell proliferation increased; in particular, the CD146+ stem cells substantially increased. At 1 month after surgery, there was more fibrocartilage in the hydrogel+BMSC-Exos group than in the other groups. Biomechanical testing showed that the maximum force, strength, and elastic modulus were significantly improved in the hydrogel+BMSC-Exos group. CONCLUSIONS Our study provides evidence that the local administration of BMSC-Exos promotes the formation of fibrocartilage by increasing M2 macrophage polarization in tendon-to-bone healing, leading to improved biomechanical properties. These findings provide a basis for the potential clinical use of BMSC-Exos in tendon-bone repair.","2020-05-05","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","e923328","","","26","","Med Sci Monit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32369458 PMCID: PMC7218969","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\W8UZPCVJ\Shi et al. - 2020 - Exosomes Derived from Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (B.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32369458","","Animals; Apoptosis; Bone and Bones; Bone Marrow Cells; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; China; Exosomes; Inflammation; Macrophage Activation; Macrophages; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Tendon Injuries; Tendons; Wound Healing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, one major problem for stem cell-derived exosome therapies is identifying appropriate source cells. In the present study, we aimed to compare the bone regenerative effect of exosomes secreted by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) derived from type 1 diabetes rats (dBMSC-exos) and exosomes secreted by BMSCs derived from normal rats (nBMSC-exos). BMSCs were isolated from rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and normal rats. dBMSC-exos and nBMSC-exos were isolated by an ultracentrifugation method and identified. The effects of dBMSC-exos and nBMSC-exos on the proliferation and migration of BMSCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were investigated. The effects of exosomes on the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and the angiogenic activity of HUVECs were compared. Finally, a rat calvarial defect model was used to compare the effects of exosomes on bone regeneration and neovascularization in vivo. In vitro, dBMSC-exos and nBMSC-exos both enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and promoted the angiogenic activity of HUVECs, but nBMSC-exos had a greater effect than dBMSC-exos. Similarly, in vivo, both dBMSC-exos and nBMSC-exos promoted bone regeneration and neovascularization in rat calvarial defects, but the therapeutic effect of nBMSC-exos was superior to that of dBMSC-exos. The present study demonstrates for the first time that the bone regenerative effect of exosomes derived from BMSCs is impaired in type 1 diabetes, indicating that for patients with type 1 diabetes, the autologous transplantation of BMSC-exos to promote bone regeneration may be inappropriate.

Stem cell-derived exosomes are emerging as promising therapeutical approaches to treat diverse aging-related osseous diseases. Herein, a previously reported osteoinductive exosome (OI-exo) was applied as a therapeutic agent for bone repair in aging individuals and its internalization mechanisms in senescent bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) were explored. The results demonstrated that OI-exos derived from young BMSCs could partially rescue the proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and alleviate aging phenotypes in vitro. OI-exo-delivered hierarchical mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) scaffold effectively promote in vivo bone formation in aging rat cranial defect model. However, the osteogenic effects of OI-exo both in vitro and in vivo were compromised in senescent individuals and for aging BMSCs compared to younger ones. This study revealed that non-senescent BMSCs internalized exosomes exclusively via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while senescent BMSCs additionally evoked macropinocytosis and caveolae-mediated endocytosis to mediate the internalization of exosomes. The alteration of endocytic manner of senescent BMSCs and the involvement of macropinocytosis might be responsible for the compromised effects of therapeutical exosomes. The phenomena discovered in this study could also be extended to other scenarios where drugs or treatments exerted compromised effects in aging individuals. The influence of endocytic manner, avoidance of macropinocytosis-related negative effects should be taken into considerations in future therapeutic design for aging populations.","2022","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","1090914","","","10","","Front Bioeng Biotechnol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36686252 PMCID: PMC9846034","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36686252","","bone marrow stem cells; bone regeneration; endocytosis; exosomes; osteogenic differentiation; senescence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extracellular vesicles (EVs)-based cell-free regenerative therapies represent a promising alternative for traditional treatments. Developmental biology suggests matrix vesicles (MVs), a subtype of EVs, contain mineralizing-related biomolecules and play an important role in osteogenesis. Thus, we explore the therapeutic benefits and expect to find an optimized strategy for MV application. METHODS: Healthy human dental follicle cells (DFCs) were cultured with the osteogenic medium to generate MVs. Media MVs (MMVs) were isolated from culture supernatant, and collagenase-released MVs (CRMVs) were acquired from collagenase-digested cell suspension. We compared the biological features of the two MVs and investigated their induction of cell proliferation, migration, mineralization, and the modulation of osteogenic genes expression. Furthermore, we investigated the long-term regenerative capacity of MMVs and CRMVs in an alveolar bone defect rat model. RESULTS: We found that both DFC-derived MMVs and CRMVs effectively improved the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of DFCs. Notably, CRMVs showed better bone regeneration capabilities. Compared to MMVs, CRMVs-induced DFCs exhibited increased synthesis of osteogenic marker proteins including ALP, OCN, OPN, and MMP-2. In the treatment of murine alveolar bone defects, CRMV-loaded collagen scaffold brought more significant therapeutic outcomes with less unhealing areas and more mature bone tissues in comparison with MMVs and acquired the effects resembling DFCs-based treatment. Furthermore, the western blotting results demonstrated the activation of the PLC/PKC/MAPK pathway in CRMVs-induced DFCs, while this cascade was inhibited by MMVs. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our findings revealed a novel cell-free regenerative therapy for repairing alveolar bone defects by specific MV subtypes and suggest that PLC/PKC/MAPK pathways contribute to MVs-mediated alveolar bone regeneration.","2022-01-29","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","41","","1","13","","Stem Cell Res Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35093186 PMCID: PMC8800263","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35093186","","Animals; Bone regeneration; Bone Regeneration; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Dental follicle cells; Dental Sac; Extracellular vesicles; Matrix vesicles; Mice; Osteogenesis; Rats; Stem Cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, the development of 3D printing biomaterials, including poly(lactide) (3D-PLA), enriched with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and/or their derivatives, such as extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been achieving promising results. In this study, in vitro results showed an increased expression of osteogenic and angiogenic markers, as RUNX2, VEGFA, OPN and COL1A1 in the living construct 3D-PLA/human Gingival MSCs (hGMSCs)/EVs. Considering that EVs carry and transfer proteins, mRNA and microRNA into target cells, we evaluated miR-2861 and miR-210 expression related to osteoangiogenesis commitment. Histological examination of rats implanted with 3D-PLA/hGMSCs/EVs evidenced the activation of bone regeneration and of the vascularization process, confirmed also by MicroCT. In synthesis, an upregulation of miR-2861 and -210 other than RUNX2, VEGFA, OPN and COL1A1 was evident in cells cultured in the presence of the biomaterial and EVs. Then, these results evidenced that EVs may enhance bone regeneration in calvaria defects, in association with an enhanced vascularization offering a novel regulatory system in the osteoangiogenesis evolution. The application of new strategies to improve biomaterial engraftment is of great interest in the regenerative medicine and can represent a way to promote bone regeneration.","2019-07-02","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","3256","","13","20","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31269731 PMCID: PMC6651609","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269731","","angiogenesis; Animals; Cells, Cultured; extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Gingiva; Humans; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; mesenchymal stem cells; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; microRNA; MicroRNAs; Neovascularization, Physiologic; osteogenesis; Osteogenesis; Polyesters; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Rats, Wistar; scaffold; Tissue Scaffolds; Up-Regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although sulfated GAGs (sGAGs) appear intracellularly, the knowledge about intracellular effects and putative interaction partners is scarce. Here we used an affinity-purification mass spectrometry-based (AP-MS) approach to identify novel and particularly intracellular sGAG-interacting proteins in human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC). Overall, 477 proteins were found interacting with at least one of four distinct sGAGs. Enrichment analysis for protein localization showed that mainly intracellular and cell-associated interacting proteins were identified. The interaction of sGAG with α2-macroglobulin receptor-associated protein (LRPAP1), exportin-1 (XPO1), and serine protease HTRA1 (HTRA1) was confirmed in reverse assays. Consecutive pathway and cluster analysis led to the identification of biological processes, namely processes involving binding and processing of nucleic acids, LRP1-dependent endocytosis, and exosome formation. Respecting the preferentially intracellular localization of sGAG in vesicle-like structures, also the interaction data indicate sGAG-specific modulation of vesicle-based transport processes. By identifying many sGAG-specific interacting proteins, our data provide a resource for upcoming studies aimed at molecular mechanisms and understanding of sGAG cellular effects.","2021-10-26","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","1427-1440","","11","402","","Biol Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34472763","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34472763","","Cells, Cultured; Chromatography, Liquid; Exportin 1 Protein; GAG-biotin; Glycosaminoglycans; hBMSC; High-Temperature Requirement A Serine Peptidase 1; Humans; Karyopherins; LC-MS/MS; LDL-Receptor Related Protein-Associated Protein; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; pull-down approach; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; SaOS2/osteoblast cell line; sulfated glycosaminoglycan derivatives; Tandem Mass Spectrometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accumulating evidence supports the role of exosomes secreted by endothelial progenitor cells (EPC-Exos) in stimulating angiogenesis, which is closely coupled with osteogenesis. This study aimed to investigate whether EPC-Exos promote bone regeneration during DO in rats. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from the supernatants of rat bone marrow EPCs via ultracentrifugation and characterized via transmission electron microscopy, tunable resistive pulse sensing analysis, and western blot analysis. Unilateral tibial DO models were generated using 68 Sprague-Dawley rats with a distraction rate of 0.5 mm per day for 10 days. After local injection of EPC-Exos into the distraction gaps after distraction, the therapeutic effects of EPC-Exos on bone regeneration and angiogenesis were assessed via X-ray, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), and biomechanical and histological analyses. Pro-angiogenic effects and the potential mechanism underlying the effects of EPC-Exos on human umbilical vein endothelial cells were subsequently evaluated via in vitro assays including Cell Counting Kit-8, wound healing, tube formation, and western blot assays. RESULTS: EPC-Exos were spherical or cup-shaped vesicles ranging from 50 to 150 nm in diameter and expressed markers including CD9, Alix, and TSG101. X-ray, micro-CT, and histological analyses revealed that bone regeneration was markedly accelerated in rats treated with EPC-Exos. The distracted tibias from the Exos group also displayed enhanced mechanical properties. Moreover, vessel density was higher in the Exos group than in the control group. In addition, in vitro analyses revealed that EPC-Exos enhanced the proliferation, migration, and angiogenic capacity of endothelial cells in an miR-126-dependent manner. Further, EPC-Exos downregulated SPRED1 and activated Raf/ERK signaling.

The potential mechanisms were further investigated. RESULTS: The effect of exosomes combined with DPSCs was remarkable on bone regeneration in vivo and exosomes promoted osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs in vitro. Mechanistically, exosomes increased the expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) in DPSCs by transferring TFAM mRNA.

As a vital mediator between inflammatory response and bone regeneration, M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (M2-Exos) attenuate inflammation and promote tissue repair. However, due to a lack of specific targeting property, M2-Exos will be rapidly eliminated after systematic administration, thus compromising their effectiveness in promoting bone regeneration. To solve this hurdle, we initially harvested and characterized the pro-osteogenic properties of M2-Exos. A bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-specific aptamer was synthesized and 3-way junction (3WJ) RNA nanoparticles were applied to conjugate the BMSC-specific aptamer and M2-Exos. In vitro assays revealed that M2-Exos bore the representative features of exosomes and significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. 3WJ RNA nanoparticles-aptamer functionalized M2-Exos (3WJ-BMSCapt/M2-Exos) maintained the original physical characteristics of M2-Exos, but bore a high specific binding ability to BMSCs.

Recently, polylactic acid (PLA), calcium silicates (CaSi), and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) have been used to produce bioresorbable functional mineral-doped porous scaffolds-through thermally induced phase separation technique, as materials for bone regeneration. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mineral-doped PLA-based porous scaffolds enriched with exosome vesicles (EVs) on osteogenic commitment of human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hAD-MSCs). Two different mineral-doped scaffolds were produced: PLA-10CaSi-10DCPD and PLA-5CaSi-5DCPD. Scaffolds surface micromorphology was investigated by ESEM-EDX before and after 28 days immersion in simulated body fluid (HBSS). Exosomes were deposited on the surface of the scaffolds and the effect of exosome-enriched scaffolds on osteogenic commitment of hAD-MSCs cultured in proximity of the scaffolds has been evaluated by real time PCR. In addition, the biocompatibility was evaluated by direct-contact seeding hAD-MSCs on scaffolds surface-using MTT viability test. In both formulations, ESEM showed pores similar in shape (circular and elliptic) and size (from 10-30 µm diameter). The porosity of the scaffolds decreased after 28 days immersion in simulated body fluid. Mineral-doped scaffolds showed a dynamic surface and created a suitable bone-forming microenvironment. The presence of the mineral fillers increased the osteogenic commitment of hAD-MSCs. Exosomes were easily entrapped on the surface of the scaffolds and their presence improved gene expression of major markers of osteogenesis such as collagen type I, osteopontin, osteonectin, osteocalcin. The experimental scaffolds enriched with exosomes, in particular PLA-10CaSi-10DCPD, increased the osteogenic commitment of MSCs. In conclusion, the enrichment of bioresorbable functional scaffolds with exosomes is confirmed as a potential strategy to improve bone regeneration procedures.","2020-02-29","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","432","","3","10","","Nanomaterials (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32121340 PMCID: PMC7153699","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32121340","","bioresorbable scaffold; calcium silicates; exosome enriched scaffolds; exosomes; green bioplastics; human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hAD-MSCs), polylactic acid scaffold; nanodelivery; natural nanovesicles; personalized regenerative medicine.; regenerative bone healing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are commonly used to promote vessel formation and osteoblastic differentiation in tissue engineering. Previous studies have demonstrated that EPCs regulate both proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Understanding this mechanism is critical to developing more effective treatments. The role of extracellular vesicles in cell‑to‑cell communication has attracted substantial attention. These small vesicles deliver proteins, DNA, and RNA and consequently regulate the commitment, function, and differentiation of target cells. In the present study, EPC‑derived extracellular vesicles (EPC‑EVs were isolated using gradient ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration and the influence of EPC‑EVs on BMSC osteoblastic differentiation and proliferation was examined in vitro. The results indicated that EPC‑EVs regulate the osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs by inhibiting the expression of osteogenic genes and increasing proliferation in vitro. It is suggested that the results regarding the role of EPC‑EVs will provide a novel way to explain the crosstalk between EPCs and BMSCs.","2017-11","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","7018-7024","","5","16","","Mol Med Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28901383","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28901383","","Animals; Bone Marrow Cells; Cell Communication; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit; Culture Media, Conditioned; Endothelial Progenitor Cells; Extracellular Vesicles; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Microscopy, Confocal; Osteocalcin; Osteogenesis; Tetraspanin 30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, collagen membranes possess ideal biological properties and can support infiltration and proliferation of osteoblasts, promoting bone regeneration. Our study aimed to develop a new biocompatible osteogenic construct composed of a commercially available collagen membrane (Evolution [Evo]), human periodontal-ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) enriched with extracellular vesicles (EVs), or polyethylenimine (PEI)-engineered EVs (PEI-EVs). METHODS: Osteogenic ability and expression of osteogenic genes were evaluated in vitro in hPDLSCs cultured with or without Evo, with Evo and EVs, or PEI-EVs. In addition, the bone-regeneration capacity of Evo, Evo enriched with hPDLSCs, Evo enriched with hPDLSCs and EVs/PEI-EVs was investigated in rats subjected to calvarial defects. RESULTS: Our results showed that Evo enriched with EVs and PEI-EVs showed high biocompatibility and osteogenic properties in vitro and in vivo. In addition, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction demonstrated the upregulation of osteogenic genes, such as TGFB1, MMP8, TUFT1, TFIP11, BMP2, and BMP4, in the presence of PEI-EVs. Upregulation of BMP2/4 was confirmed for Evo enriched with PEI-EVs and hPDLSCs both in vitro by Western blot and in vivo by immunofluorescence. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that Evo enriched with hPDLSCs and PEI-EVs is able to promote a bone-regeneration process for the treatment of calvarium and ossification defects caused by accidental or surgery trauma. In particular, PEI-EVs had a significant role in activation of the osteogenic process.","2018","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","3805-3825","","","13","","Int J Nanomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29988728 PMCID: PMC6029600","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29988728","","Animals; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4; bone regeneration; Bone Regeneration; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Collagen; collagen membrane; extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; human periodontal-ligament stem cells; Humans; living construct; Male; Osteogenesis; Periodontal Ligament; Polyethyleneimine; Rats, Wistar; Skull; Stem Cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Applying dual luciferase reporter assay, we explored the target binding of miR-124-3p and Gal-3. We examined osteocyte-derived exosomes with transmission electron microscopy and detected miR-124-3p, Gal-3, and IL-6 expression in exosomes. Saliva Gal-3 was increased in DM compared with controls but decreased in patients with moderate periodontitis and DM compared with those who had moderate periodontitis only. Alveolar bone mass was increased in DM and exacerbated in DM with periodontitis. Gal-3 and Runx2 were both increased in periodontitis and DM compared with controls, but decreased in DM with periodontitis compared with DM alone.

Primary human DC-secreted EV (DC-EV), isolated by ultracentrifugation, were characterized for their size, morphology and protein markers, indicating an enrichment in exosomes. DC-EV were readily internalized by human bone marrow-derived MSC, without impacting significantly their proliferation or influencing their osteogenic/chondrogenic differentiation. Importantly, DC-EV significantly and dose-dependently promoted MSC recruitment across a transwell system and enhanced MSC migration in a microfluidic chemotaxis assay. DC-EV content was analysed by chemokine array, indicating the presence of chemotactic mediators. Osteopontin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were confirmed inside EV. In summary, DC-EV are naturally loaded with chemoattractants and can contribute to cell recruitment, thus inspiring the development of new tissue regeneration strategies.","2017-05-10","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","1667","","1","7","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28490808 PMCID: PMC5431789","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28490808","","Cell Differentiation; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Dendritic Cells; Endocytosis; Exosomes; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; Mesenchymal Stem Cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prostate and breast cancer patients frequently exhibit osteoblastic-type and osteolytic-type bone metastasis, respectively. In metastatic lesions, tumor cells interact with many different cell types, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and mesenchymal stem cells, resulting in an osteoblastic or osteolytic phenotype. However, the mechanisms responsible for the modification of bone remodeling have not been fully elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are transferred between cells via exosomes and serve as intercellular communication tools, and numerous studies have demonstrated that cancer-secreted miRNAs are capable of modifying the tumor microenvironment. Thus, cancer-secreted miRNAs can induce an osteoblastic or osteolytic phenotype in the bone metastatic microenvironment. In this study, we performed a comprehensive expression analysis of exosomal miRNAs secreted by several human cancer cell lines and identified eight types of human miRNAs that were highly expressed in exosomes from osteoblastic phenotype-inducing prostate cancer cell lines. One of these miRNAs, hsa-miR-940, significantly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro by targeting ARHGAP1 and FAM134A Interestingly, although MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells are commonly known as an osteolytic phenotype-inducing cancer cell line, the implantation of miR-940-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells induced extensive osteoblastic lesions in the resulting tumors by facilitating the osteogenic differentiation of host mesenchymal cells. Our results suggest that the phenotypes of bone metastases can be induced by miRNAs secreted by cancer cells in the bone microenvironment.","2018-02-27","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","2204-2209","","9","115","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29440427 PMCID: PMC5834702","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29440427","","Adenocarcinoma; Animals; bone microenvironment; Bone Neoplasms; Bone Substitutes; Breast Neoplasms; cancer-secreted microRNA; Cell Line, Tumor; exosome; Female; GTPase-Activating Proteins; Humans; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms, Experimental; osteoblastic bone metastasis; prostate cancer; Prostatic Neoplasms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: MSC-derived exosomes exhibited a cup-shaped morphology and were internalized by macrophages and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs). The pattern of internalization of scaffold-immobilized exosomes was similar in RAW264.7 cells and hBMSCs after 4h and 24h of co-culture. Assessment of macrophage morphology under inflammatory conditions by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and confocal microscopy demonstrated macrophages were significantly elongated and expression of pro-inflammatory genes markedly decreased when co-cultured with PCL/PDA + GSNO + exosome scaffolds. Furthermore, this scaffold modification significantly enhanced osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs.

Further, MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are established vehicles of paracrine factors, supporting inter-cellular communication between MSC and other interacting cell types, such as monocytes/macrophages. However, the information about the immunomodulatory potential of EVs derived from MSC and biomaterial constructs (MSC + BCP:EV) and inflammatory primed constructs (MSCp + BCP:EV) are scarce. Hence, we isolated and characterized EVs from these different systems, and compared their cytokine contents with plastic-adherent MSC-derived EVs (MSC:EV). When EVs from all three MSC systems were added to the primary blood-derived macrophages in vitro, significantly higher numbers of M0 (naive) macrophages shifted to M2-like (anti-inflammatory) by MSCp + BCP:EV treatment. Further, this treatment led to enhanced switching of M1 polarized macrophages to M2 polarized, and conversely, M2 to M1, as evaluated by determining the M1/M2 ratios after treatment. The enhanced macrophage modulation by MSCp + BCP:EV was attributed to their higher immunomodulatory (TNFα, IL1β, IL5), angiogenic (VEGF), and chemokine-rich (RANTES, MCP1, MIP1β) cytokine cargo. In conclusion, we successfully isolated and characterized EVs from MSC + BCP constructs and demonstrated that, depending upon the tissue microenvironment, these EVs contribute towards modulating the macrophage-mediated inflammation and healing responses. The study offers new insights into the use of biomaterial-induced EVs for MSC secretome delivery, as a step towards future 'cell-free' bone regenerative therapies.","2022-01-29","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","470","","3","11","","Cells","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35159282 PMCID: PMC8834243","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35159282","","Biocompatible Materials; biomaterial; biphasic calcium phosphate; bone regeneration; cytokines; Cytokines; Extracellular Vesicles; extracellular vesicles or EV; Humans; Hydroxyapatites; immunomodulation; macrophage polarization; macrophages; Macrophages; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; mesenchymal stromal cells; monocytes; secretome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to the osteogenesis of ADSCs into osteoblasts, the crosstalk of ADSCs with osteoblasts through the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) may also contribute to bone formation in ADSC-based BTE. We investigated the effect of ADSC-secreted EVs (ADSC-EVs) on osteoblast function. ADSC-EVs (size ≤ 1000 nm) were isolated from the culture supernatant of ADSCs through ultracentrifugation. The ADSC-EVs were observed to be spherical under a transmission electron microscope. The ADSC-EVs were positive for CD9, CD81, and Alix, but β-actin was not detected.

The GO analysis revealed that these miRNAs are highly relevant to skeletal system morphogenesis and bone development.

In the present study, exosomes derived from 3T3L1 preadipocytes (3T3L1‑exo) were purified and characterized. The effects and potential mechanisms of 3T3L1‑exo on 3T3L1 cell ossification were examined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, electron microscopy, RNA sequencing and histological analysis. The current study confirmed that 3T3L1‑exo enhanced 3T3L1 preadipocyte osteogenic differentiation, as revealed by upregulation of osteogenic differentiation‑associated genes and increased Alizarin Red staining. Furthermore, the microRNA (miR) expression profiles of 3T3L1‑exo and 3T3L1 preadipocytes were sequenced and compared. The results of a further analysis demonstrated that miR‑223 expression was reduced in 3T3L1 preadipocytes stimulated by 3T3L1‑exo compared with in unstimulated cells. This finding suggested that 3T3L1‑exo promoted 3T3L1 bone formation by decreasing miR‑223 through a competitive mechanism, another miRNA, or another factor. The mechanism by which miR‑223 is decreased warrants further investigation.

To this point, we aimed to explore the role of DXM in regulating the paracrine activity of MSCs through evaluating the release and function of MSC-MVs, based on their physicochemical characteristics and support on osteogenic response. Results showed that DXM had no evident impact on the release of MSC-MVs but played a pivotal role in regulating the function of MSC-MVs. MVs obtained from the DXM-stimulated MSCs (DXM-MVs) increased MC3T3 cell proliferation and migration and upregulated Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteopontin (OPN) expression. The repair efficiency of DXM-MVs for femur defects was further investigated in an established rat model. It was found that DXM-MVs accelerated the healing process of bone formation in the defect area. Thus, we conclude that using DXM as stimuli to obtain functional MSCs-MVs could become a valuable tool for promoting bone regeneration.","2018","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","7231739","","","2018","","Stem Cells Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29760734 PMCID: PMC5926524","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29760734","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are important in bone-related diseases. Exosomes, as mediators of cell communication, have potential in cell processes. Previous studies have focused on muscle factors' regulation of bone remodeling, but research on exosomes is lacking. METHODS: In order to confirm the therapeutic effect of mechanically stimulated myocytes (C2C12) derived exosomes (Exosome-MS) on the Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis(GIOP) compared with unmechanically stimulated myocytes (C2C12) derived exosomes (Exosomes), we established a dexamethasone-induced osteoporosis model in vivo and in vitro. Cell viability and proliferation were assessed using CCK8 and EDU assays. Osteogenic potential was evaluated through Western blotting, real-time PCR, alkaline phosphatase activity assay, and alizarin red staining. Differential expression of miRNAs was determined by high-throughput sequencing. The regulatory mechanism of miR-92a-3p on cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation via the PTEN/AKT pathway was investigated using real-time PCR, luciferase reporter gene assay, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. The therapeutic effects of exosomes were evaluated in vivo using microCT, HE staining, Masson staining, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In this study, we found that exosomes derived from mechanical stress had a positive impact on the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Importantly, we demonstrated that miR-92a-3p mimics could reverse dexamethasone-induced osteoporosis in vitro and in vivo, indicating that mechanical stress-induced mouse myoblast-derived exosomes could promote osteogenesis and prevent the occurrence and progression of osteoporosis in mice through miR-92a-3p/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Exosomes derived from mechanical stress-induced myoblasts can promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells through miR-92a-3p/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, and can have a therapeutic effect on glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in mice in vivo.","2023","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","7583-7603","","","18","","Int J Nanomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38106447 PMCID: PMC10725637","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38106447","","AKT signaling; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Dexamethasone; Exosome; Exosomes; Glucocorticoids; Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells; Mechanical stimulation; Mice; MicroRNAs; miR-92a-3p; Osteogenesis; Osteoporosis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; Stress, Mechanical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cell-free tissue regeneration thus has a potential to avoid these problems. Stem cell derived exosomes do not cause immune rejection or generate malignant tumors. Here, exosomes that can induce osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are identified and used to decorate 3D-printed titanium alloy scaffolds to achieve cell-free bone regeneration. Specifically, the exosomes secreted by hMSCs osteogenically pre-differentiated for different times are used to induce the osteogenesis of hMSCs. It is discovered that pre-differentiation for 10 and 15 days leads to the production of osteogenic exosomes. The purified exosomes are then loaded into the scaffolds. It is found that the cell-free exosome-coated scaffolds regenerate bone tissue as efficiently as hMSC-seeded exosome-free scaffolds within 12 weeks. RNA-sequencing suggests that the osteogenic exosomes induce the osteogenic differentiation by using their cargos, including upregulated osteogenic miRNAs (Hsa-miR-146a-5p, Hsa-miR-503-5p, Hsa-miR-483-3p, and Hsa-miR-129-5p) or downregulated anti-osteogenic miRNAs (Hsa-miR-32-5p, Hsa-miR-133a-3p, and Hsa-miR-204-5p), to activate the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. Consequently, identification of osteogenic exosomes secreted by pre-differentiated stem cells and the use of them to replace stem cells represent a novel cell-free bone regeneration strategy.","2020-10","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","2001334","","19","7","","Adv Sci (Weinh)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33042751 PMCID: PMC7539212","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042751","","bone regeneration; cell‐free scaffolds; exosomes; miRNAs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such a disorder of adipogenic/osteogenic differentiation, affecting bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), contributes to bone loss during aging. Here, we investigated the effects of extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from human (h)BMSCs during different stages of osteogenic differentiation on the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacity of naïve (undifferentiated) hBMSCs. We observed that all EV groups increased viability and proliferation capacity and suppressed the apoptosis of naïve hBMSCs. In particular, EVs derived from hBMSCs at late-stage osteogenic differentiation promoted the osteogenic potential of naïve hBMSCs more effectively than EVs derived from naïve hBMSCs (naïve EVs), as indicated by the increased gene expression of COL1A1 and OPN. In contrast, the adipogenic differentiation capacity of naïve hBMSCs was inhibited by treatment with EVs from osteogenic differentiated hBMSCs. Proteomic analysis revealed that osteogenic EVs and naïve EVs contained distinct protein profiles, with pro-osteogenic and anti-adipogenic proteins encapsulated in osteogenic EVs. We speculate that osteogenic EVs could serve as an intercellular communication system between bone- and bone-marrow adipose tissue, for transporting osteogenic factors and thus favoring pro-osteogenic processes. Our data may support the theory of an endocrine circuit with the skeleton functioning as a ductless gland.","2022-08-11","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","2491","","16","11","","Cells","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36010568 PMCID: PMC9406723","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36010568","","Adipogenesis; adipogenic differentiation; bone regeneration; Cell Differentiation; ECM remodeling; extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; mesenchymal stem cells; Osteogenesis; osteogenic differentiation; osteogenic potential; Proteomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sympatho-adrenergic activation is implicated in stress-induced depression and leads to bone loss, but the mechanisms and therapeutics are incompletely elucidated. Here, it is revealed that sympathetic neurostress through the β1/2 -adrenergic receptor (β1/2-AR) signaling triggers the transcription response of a microRNA, miR-21, in osteoblasts, which is transferred to osteoclast progenitors via exosomes for dictating osteoclastogenesis. After confirming that miR-21 deficiency retards the β1/2-AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO)-induced osteopenia, it is shown that the pharmacological inhibition of exosome release by two clinically-relevant drugs, dimethyl amiloride and omeprazole, suppresses osteoblastic miR-21 transfer and ameliorates bone loss under both ISO and chronic variable stress (CVS)-induced depression conditions. A targeted delivery approach to specifically silence osteoblastic miR-21 is further applied, which is effective in rescuing the bone remodeling balance and ameliorating ISO- and CVS-induced osteopenias. These results decipher a previously unrecognized paradigm that neural cues drive exosomal microRNA communication to regulate organ homeostasis and help to establish feasible strategies to counteract bone loss under psychological stresses.","2022-03","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","e2100763","","3","6","","Small Methods","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35312228","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35312228","","Bone and Bones; Bone Diseases, Metabolic; bones; depression; exosome; Exosomes; Homeostasis; Humans; microRNA; MicroRNAs; sympathetic nervous system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Synovial fluid samples were obtained from three patients, and SFDCs were isolated and expanded either in a 2D monolayer culture or seeded within a transglutaminase cross-linked gelatin (Col-Tgel) to create a 3D gel culture. Exosomes derived from each environment were isolated and characterized. Then, their effects on cartilage-cell proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation were assessed using an in vitro organoid model, and their potential for enhancing cartilage repair was evaluated using a rat cartilage defect model. RESULTS: SFDCs obtained from different donors reached a state of senescence after four passages in 2D culture. However, transferring these cells to a 3D culture environment mitigated the senescence and improved cell viability. The 3D-cultured exosomes exhibited enhanced potency in promoting chondrogenic differentiation, as evidenced by the increased expression of chondrogenic genes and greater deposition of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix. Furthermore, the 3D-cultured exosomes demonstrated superior effectiveness in enhancing cartilage repair and exhibited better healing properties compared to exosomes derived from a 2D culture. CONCLUSIONS: The optimized 3D culture provided a more favorable environment for the proliferation of human synovial cells and the secretion of exosomes compared to the 2D culture. The 3D-cultured exosomes exhibited greater potential for promoting chondrogenic gene expression in vitro and demonstrated improved healing properties in repairing cartilage defects compared to exosomes derived from the 2D culture.","2023-11-25","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","3145","","12","11","","Biomedicines","Enhancement of Chondrogenic Markers by Exosomes Derived from Cultured Human Synovial Fluid-Derived Cells","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38137366 PMCID: PMC10740632","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38137366","","3D encapsulation; cartilage repair; chondrogenesis; exosome; synovial fluid-derived cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To explore these mechanisms, we first isolated PRP-derived Exos (PRP-Exos). Using immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) treated with PBS, PRP, or PRP-Exos, we conducted a series of in vitro Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), EdU, scratch wound, and transwell assays. We then established a wound defect model in vivo in mice and assessed differences in the mRNA expression within these wounds to better understand the basis for PRP-mediated wound healing. The functions of PRP-Exos and USP15 in the context of wound healing were then confirmed through additional in vitro and in vivo experiments. We found that PRP-Exos effectively promoted the in vitro proliferation, migration, and wound healing activity of HaCaT cells. USP15 was further identified as a key mediator through which these PRP-Exos were able to promote tissue repair both in vitro and in vivo. At a mechanistic level, USP15 enhanced the functional properties of HaCaT cells by promoting EIF4A1 deubiquitination. Thus, PRP-Exos and USP15 represent promising tools that can promote wound healing via enhancing epithelial regeneration.","2021","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","9674809","","","2021","","Oxid Med Cell Longev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34422211 PMCID: PMC8371654","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422211","","Animals; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4A; Exosomes; Humans; Keratinocytes; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Platelet-Rich Plasma; Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases; Ubiquitination; Wound Healing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EVs contain numerous functional proteins and nucleic acids derived from their parent cells and have different roles depending on their origin. Functionally, EVs transfer these biological materials from the parent cell to the recipient and thus exhibits a novel therapeutic platform for delivering therapeutics molecules to the target tissue. In this regard, EVs derived from stem cells such as Mesenchymal Stem Cells and iPSCs have demonstrated a higher ability to benefit regenerative medicine. Even though these stem cells share some common properties, due to the differences in their origin (cell sources, the hierarchy of potency, etc) the EVs cargo profiling and functionality may vary. METHOD: We used iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis to conduct a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of EVs derived from iPSCs and various tissue-specific MSCs in this study. Additionally, the data was analyzed using a variety of bioinformatic tools, including ProteinPilot for peptide and protein identification and quantification; Funrich, GO, Reactome, and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) for pathway enrichment; the STRING database, and the inBio Discover tool for identifying known and predicted Protein-Protein networks. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed 223 differentially expressed proteins in these EVs; however, Wharton's jelly MSC-EV contained more exclusive proteins with higher protein expression levels. Additionally, 113 proteins were abundant in MSC-EVs, while others were shared between MSC-EVs and iPSC-EVs. Further, based on an in-depth examination of the proteins, their associated pathways, and their interactions with other proteins, it was determined that these proteins are involved in bone regeneration (9.3%), wound healing (4.4%), immune regulation (8.9%), cardiac regeneration (6.6%), neuro regeneration (8.9%), and hepatic regeneration (3.5%). CONCLUSION: Overall, the results of our proteomic analysis indicate that EVs derived from MSCs have a more robust profile of proteins with higher expression levels than iPSCs. This is a significant finding, as it demonstrates the critical therapeutic role of EVs in a variety of diseases, as demonstrated by enrichment analysis, their versatility, and broad application potential.","2022-11-15","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","113354","","2","420","","Exp Cell Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36126717","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36126717","","Extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Functional proteins. biomedical applications; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Nucleic Acids; Proteins; Proteomics; Stem cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Biofabrication strategies enable the creation of scaffolds with specific microstructural environments and biological components. Lithium (Li) has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory, osteogenic, and chondrogenic properties by promoting several intracellular signaling pathways. Currently, research focuses on fabricating scaffolds with simultaneous dual bioactivities to enhance osteochondral regeneration. In this study, we modified the surface of calcium silicate (CS) scaffolds with Li using a simple immersion technique and evaluated their capabilities for bone regeneration. The results showed that Li ions could be easily coated onto the surfaces of CS scaffolds without affecting the microstructural properties of CS itself. Furthermore, the modifications did not affect the printing capabilities of the CS, and porous scaffolds could be fabricated via extrusion. Moreover, the presence of Li improved the surface roughness and hydrophilicity, thus leading to enhanced secretion of osteochondral-related regeneration factors, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and collagen II (Col II) proteins. Subsequent in vivo studies, including histological and micro-CT analyses, confirmed that the Li-modified CS scaffolds promoted osteochondral regeneration. The transcriptome analysis suggested that the enhanced osteochondrogenic capabilities of our scaffolds were influenced by paracrine exosomes. We hope this study will inspire further research on osteochondral regeneration.","2023-10","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","100728","","","22","","Mater Today Bio","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37538916 PMCID: PMC10393792","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37538916","","3D scaffold; Additive manufacture; Calcium silicate; Exosomes; Lithium; Osteochondral defect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enhancing muscle growth by inhibiting myostatin, a growth factor negatively regulating skeletal muscle mass, is a promising approach to slow disease progression. Direct administration of myostatin propeptide, a natural inhibitor of mature myostatin, has shown limited efficacy probably due to low serum stability. Here, we demonstrate that serum stability, delivery efficiency and efficacy of propeptide can be significantly enhanced by anchoring propeptide to the surface of exosomes by fusing the inhibitory domain of myostatin propeptide into the second extracellular loop of CD63 (EXOpro). Repeated administrations of EXOpro accelerated muscle regeneration and growth, resulting in significantly increased muscle mass and functional rescue without any detectable toxicity in mdx mice. Importantly, EXOpro partially rehabilitated bone structure and promoted bone regeneration in mdx mice.

To enhance the regenerative properties of these materials, they are commonly functionalised with bioactive factors to guide growth within the developing tissue. Extracellular matrix vesicles (EVs) play an important role in facilitating endochondral ossification during long bone development and have recently emerged as important mediators of cell-cell communication coordinating bone regeneration, and thus represent an ideal target to enhance the regenerative properties of synthetic scaffolds. Therefore, in this paper we developed tools and protocols to enable the attachment of MLO-Y4 osteocyte-derived EVs onto electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds for bone repair. Initially, we optimize a method for the functionalization of PCL materials with collagen type-1 and fibronectin, inspired by the behaviour of matrix vesicles during endochondral ossification, and demonstrate that this is an effective method for the adhesion of EVs to the material surface. We then used this functionalization process to attach osteogenic EVs, collected from mechanically stimulated MLO-Y4 osteocytes, to collagen-coated electrospun PCL scaffolds. The EV-functionalized scaffold promoted osteogenic differentiation (measured by increased ALP activity) and mineralization of the matrix. In particular, EV-functionalised scaffolds exhibited significant increases in matrix mineralization particularly at earlier time points compared to uncoated and collagen-coated controls. This approach to matrix-based adhesion of EVs provides a mechanism for incorporating vesicle signalling into polyester scaffolds and demonstrates the potential of osteocyte derived EVs to enhance the rate of bone tissue regeneration.","2021-12","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","3621-3635","","12","49","","Ann Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34664147 PMCID: PMC8671272","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34664147","","Animals; Biomaterials; Bone; Cells, Cultured; Electrospinning; Extracellular Matrix; Extracellular Vesicles; Mechanobiology; Osteocytes; Osteogenesis; Polycaprolactone; Polyesters; Tissue Scaffolds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Platelets play an important and active role in the development of AS. Accumulating evidence demonstrated platelets contain diverse RNA repository inherited from megakaryocytes or microvesicles. Platelet RNAs are dynamically affected by pathological conditions and could be used as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. However, the role of the platelet RNAs in AS is elusive. In this study, we compared mRNA and circRNA profiles in platelets between AS patients and healthy controls using RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, and found 4996 mRNAs and 2942 circRNAs were differently expressed. The significantly over-expressed mRNAs in AS patients are involved in platelet activity, gap junction, focal adhesion, rap1 and toll and Imd signaling pathway. The previous identified platelet-derived immune mediators such as P2Y1, P2Y12, PF4, GPIbα, CD40L, ICAM2, CCL5 (RANTES), TGF-β (TGF-β1 and TGF-β2) and PDGF (PDGFB and PDGFA) are also included in these over expressed mRNAs, implying these factors may trigger inflammatory cascades and promote the development of AS. Additionally, we found two down-regulated circRNA (circPTPN22 and circFCHSD2) from the intersection analyses of platelets and spinal ligament tissues of AS patients. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network of these two circRNAs was constructed, and the target mRNAs were enriched in Th17 cell differentiation, inflammatory bowel disease, cell adhesion molecules, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Jak-STAT and Wnt signaling pathway, all these pathways participate in the bone remodeling and pro/anti-inflammatory immune regulation in AS. Then, qRT-PCR was performed to validate the expression of selected key mRNAs and circRNAs and the results demonstrated that the expression levels of P2Y12, GPIbα, circPTPN22 and circFCHSD2 were consistent with the sequencing analysis. In addition, the high expression of five predicted miRNAs interacting with circPTPN22 and circFCHSD2 were also detected in AS by qRT-PCR. Taken together, our study presents a comprehensive overview of mRNAs and circRNAs in platelets in AS patients and offers new insight into the mechanisms of platelet involving in the pathogenesis of AS. The mRNAs and circRNAs identified in this study may serve as candidates for diagnosis and targeted treatment of AS.","2021-12-01","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","112895","","1","409","","Exp Cell Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34717918","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34717918","","Ankylosing spondylitis; Blood Platelets; Cell Differentiation; CircRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network; Circular RNA; Computational Biology; Cytokines; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Inflammation; MicroRNAs; mRNA; Platelet; Quality of Life; RNA, Circular; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Signal Transduction; Spondylitis, Ankylosing; Up-Regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the production of regulatory cytokines by MSC transplantation is a critical modulator of tissue regeneration, we focused on exosomes, which are extracellular vesicles that contain proteins and nucleic acids, as a novel additional modulator of cell-to-cell communication and tissue regeneration. To address this, we used radiologic imaging, histological examination, and immunohistochemical analysis to evaluate the role of exosomes isolated from MSC-conditioned medium (CM) in the healing process in a femur fracture model of CD9-/- mice, a strain that is known to produce reduced levels of exosomes. We found that the bone union rate in CD9-/- mice was significantly lower than wild-type mice because of the retardation of callus formation. The retardation of fracture healing in CD9-/- mice was rescued by the injection of exosomes, but this was not the case after the injection of exosomes-free conditioned medium (CM-Exo). The levels of the bone repair-related cytokines, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), MCP-3, and stromal cell-derived factor-1 in exosomes were low compared with levels in CM and CM-Exo, suggesting that bone repair may be in part mediated by other exosome components, such as microRNAs. These results suggest that exosomes in CM facilitate the acceleration of fracture healing, and we conclude that exosomes are a novel factor of MSC paracrine signaling with an important role in the tissue repair process.

Exosomes have been demonstrated to facilitate bone regeneration through enhanced osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Moreover, functional stimulation to mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) was reported to further boost the pro-angiogenic ability of exosomes secreted. However, whether the stimulation by bioactive trace elements of biomaterials could enhance pro-angiogenic capability of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs)-derived exosomes and consequently promote in vivo vascularized bone regeneration has not been investigated. In this study, strontium-substituted calcium silicate (Sr-CS) was chosen and the biological function of BMSCs-derived exosomes after Sr-CS stimulation (Sr-CS-Exo) was systemically investigated. The results showed that Sr-CS-Exo could significantly promote in vitro angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which might be attributed to elevated pro-angiogenic miR-146a cargos and inhibition of Smad4 and NF2 proteins. Moreover, the in vivo study confirmed that Sr-CS-Exo possessed superior pro-angiogenic ability, which contributed to the accelerated developmental vascularization in zebrafish along with the neovascularization and bone regeneration in rat distal femur defects.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and a moderate inflammatory response at the prosthesis-bone interface play an important role in osteointegration. Here, we developed microarc oxide titanium implant loaded engineered exosomes (S-Exos) to promote osseointegration at the prosthesis-bone interface. First, Smurf1-shRNA was transferred into the BMSCs using a viral vector to prepare S-Exos, which were subsequently immobilized to the microarc oxide titanium implant surface with positively charged polyethyleneimine. The immobilized S-Exos could be slowly and uniformly released and subsequently phagocytosed by BMSCs and macrophages. Once the S-Exos were phagocytosed, they could simultaneously activate the BMP/Smad signaling pathway in the BMSCs and promote macrophage M2 polarization, both of which enhance osseointegration. Specifically, this S-Exos coating exhibits a dual effect of promoting osseointegration, including the osseointegration of BMSCs by activating the BMP/Smad signaling pathway and the macrophage M2 polarization promoting osseointegration. In summary, the construction of S-Exos modified microarc oxide titanium implants could provide a new method for promoting osteointegration between the prosthesis and host bone in revision total hip arthroplasty.","2022-10-19","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","46161-46175","","41","14","","ACS Appl Mater Interfaces","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36203406","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36203406","","engineered exosomes; Exosomes; microarc oxidation titanium; osseointegration; Osseointegration; Osteogenesis; Oxides; periprosthetic bone defect; Polyethyleneimine; revision of total hip arthroplasty; RNA, Small Interfering; Titanium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an aged society with increased life expectancy, the incidence rate of osteoporosis is also rapidly increasing. Inadequate nutrition may negatively influence bone metabolism. Recently, many studies have investigated the functionality of milk-derived exosomes, which play important roles in cell-to-cell communication. However, there are few reports of how milk-derived exosomes influence osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Here, we determined whether bovine colostrum-derived exosomes promote anti-osteoporosis in vitro and in vivo. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-stained cells were significantly inhibited in Raw264.7 cells treated with exosomes, indicating reduced osteoclast differentiation. We induced osteoporosis in mice using glucocorticoid pellets after orally administering exosomes for 2 mo. Interestingly, the bone mineral density of exosome-fed mouse groups was significantly improved compared with the glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis group without exosome treatment. In addition, Lactobacillus were decreased in the gut microbiota community of osteoporosis-induced mice, but the gut microbiota community composition was effectively restored by exosome intake. Taken together, we propose that exosomes isolated from bovine colostrum could be a potential candidate for osteoporosis prevention, bone remodeling improvement, and inhibition of bone resorption. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a protective effect of milk exosomes against osteoporosis has been demonstrated in vivo. Our results strongly suggest that bovine colostrum exosomes might be used as a prophylaxis to prevent the onset of osteoporosis. Indeed, our results offer promising alternative strategies in the nutritional management of age-related bone complications.","2020-09","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","7752-7760","","9","103","","J Dairy Sci","Short communication","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32622594","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32622594","","Animals; Bone and Bones; Bone Density; Cattle; Disease Models, Animal; Exosomes; Mice; microbiota; Milk; milk-derived exosome; osteoclast differentiation; osteoporosis; Osteoporosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No differences in growth or survival of 4T1 murine breast cancer cells were detected at a concentration of 50 µM of enoxacin or bis-enoxacin. Growth was perturbed at higher concentrations. Both 50 µM enoxacin and bis-enoxacin stimulated increases in the number of GW/Processing bodies, but there were minimal changes in microRNA levels. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from 4T1 cells treated with 50 µM enoxacin or 50 µM bis-enoxacin stimulated proliferation of RAW 264.7 cells, and both significantly inhibited osteoclastogenesis in calcitriol-stimulated mouse marrow. EVs from 4T1 cells treated with enoxacin and bis-enoxacin displayed small reductions in the amount of microRNA (miR)-146a-5p and let-7b-5p. In marked contrast, miR-214-3p, which has been shown to regulate bone remodeling, was increased 22-fold and 30-fold respectively.

Hypoxia and miR-210 play an important role in hematological malignancies. In an attempt to elucidate the specificity of the pathways of hypoxia and miR-210 in suppression of osteoblastic differentiation in MM patients, we examined the effect of miR-210 and hypoxia on expression of important cytokines and genes of myeloma cells. Differentiation of BM-MSCs towards osteoblastic cells in response to microvesicles (MVs) was also investigated. Finally, we proposed a molecular model on how HIF-1α may promote bone lesions in MM patients. To validate the effect of miR-210 and HIF-1α on targeted genes, the shRNA of HIF-1α and off-hsa-miR-210 were transfected into RPMI-8226 cells. BM-MSCs were cultured in osteoblastic inducer and 50 µg/mL of MVs derived from both hypoxic and normoxic myeloma cells. We designed an in vitro study to establish the effects of HIF-1α and miR-210 on the crosstalk between MM and osteoblasts. We here showed that hypoxia-induced miR-210 increased the mRNA expression of VLA-4, CXCR4, IL-6 and TGF-β in myeloma cells. MiR-210 is mandatory for the hypoxia-increased resistance of MM cells to melphalan. Moreover, MVs derived from hypoxic myeloma cells substantially decreased osteoblast differentiation. Considered comprehensively, our findings explain one of the reasons of bone loss that occurs at the sites of MM and a nascent crosstalk model in MM pathogenesis.","2018","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","647-662","","","17","","EXCLI J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30108468 PMCID: PMC6088223","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30108468","","hypoxia; microvesicle; miR-210; multiple myeloma; osteoblast","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) emerged as the essential paracrine factors of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that mediated tissue regeneration. However, limitations of antimicrobial activity associated with the use of sEVs have led to the urgency of new alternative strategies. Currently, we investigated the potential of a biocompatible oxygen-releasing thermosensitive hydrogel laded with sEVs secreted by bone marrow MSCs (BMMSCs) for the alveolar bone defect in periodontitis. The hydrogel composed of different polymers such as chitosan (CS), poloxamer 407 (P407), and cross-linked hyaluronic acid (c-HA) conglomerating is a kind of nanoporous structure material. Then, the gel matrix further encapsulated sEVs and calcium peroxide nanoparticles to realize the control of sEVs and oxygen release. Furthermore, ascorbic acid was added to achieve the REDOX equilibrium and acid-base equilibrium. The experiments in vivo and in vitro proved its good biocompatibility and effectively inhibited the growth of the periodontal main anaerobe, relieved periodontal pocket anaerobic infections, and promoted the periodontal defect regeneration.

Herein, focusing on practical applying problems, the osteoinductivity of MSC-exos produced by different stem cell sources (rBMSCs/rASCs) and culture conditions (osteoinductive/common) were systematically compared to screen out an optimized osteogenic exosome (BMSC-OI-exo). Via bioinformatic analyses by miRNA microarray and in vitro pathway verification by gene silencing and miRNA transfection, we first revealed that the osteoinductivity of BMSC-OI-exo was attributed to multi-component exosomal miRNAs (let-7a-5p, let-7c-5p, miR-328a-5p and miR-31a-5p). These miRNAs targeted Acvr2b/Acvr1 and regulated the competitive balance of Bmpr2/Acvr2b toward Bmpr-elicited Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation. On these bases, lyophilized delivery of BMSC-OI-exo on hierarchical mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) scaffold was developed to realize bioactivity maintenance and sustained release by entrapment in the surface microporosity of the scaffold. In a rat cranial defect model, the loading of BMSC-OI-exo efficiently enhanced the bone forming capacity of the scaffold and induced rapid initiation of bone regeneration. This paper could provide empirical bases of MSC-exo-based therapy for bone regeneration and theoretical bases of MSC-exo-induced osteogenesis mechanism.

Monocytes (MCs) and osteoclasts actively take part in controlling bone remodelling by providing signals that promote osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have attracted attention as regulators of bone remodelling. EVs facilitate intercellular communication by transferring a complex cargo of biologically active molecules to target cells. In the present study, we evaluated the potency of EVs from MCs and osteoclasts to induce a lineage-specific response in MSCs. We analysed gene expression and protein secretion by both adipose tissue-derived MSCs and bone marrow-derived MSCs after stimulation with EVs from lipopolysaccharide-activated primary human MCs and (mineral-resorbing) osteoclasts. Isolated EVs were enriched in exosomes (EVs of endosomal origin) and were free of cell debris. MC- and osteoclast-derived EVs were taken up by adipose tissue-derived MSCs. EVs from activated MCs promoted the secretion of cytokines by MSCs, which may represent an immunomodulatory mechanism. MC-derived EVs also upregulated the expression of genes encoding for matrix metalloproteinases. Therefore, we hypothesize that MCs facilitate tissue remodelling through EV-mediated signalling. We did not observe a significant effect of osteoclast-derived EVs on gene expression or protein secretion in MSCs. EV-mediated signalling might represent an additional mode of cell-cell signalling during the transition from injury and inflammation to bone regeneration and play an important role in the coupling between bone resorption and bone formation.

We evaluated the in vitro effects of hiPSC-MSC-Exos on the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) by cell-counting, scratch assays, and qRT-PCR, respectively. Gene expression profiling and bioinformatics analyses were also used to identify the underlying mechanisms in the repair. RESULTS: We found that the exosome/β-TCP combination scaffolds could enhance osteogenesis as compared to pure β-TCP scaffolds. In vitro assays showed that the exosomes could release from β-TCP and could be internalized by hBMSCs. In addition, the internalization of exosomes into hBMSCs could profoundly enhance the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Furthermore, gene expression profiling and bioinformatics analyses demonstrated that exosome/β-TCP combination scaffolds significantly altered the expression of a network of genes involved in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Functional studies further confirmed that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was the critical mediator during the exosome-induced osteogenic responses of hBMSCs. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the exosomes can enhance the osteoinductivity of β-TCP through activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway of hBMSCs, which means that the exosome/β-TCP combination scaffolds possess better osteogenesis activity than pure β-TCP scaffolds. These results indicate that naturally secreted nanocarriers-exosomes can be used as a bioactive material to improve the bioactivity of the biomaterials, and that hiPS-MSC-Exos combined with β-TCP scaffolds can be potentially used for repairing bone defects.","2016-09-20","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","136","","1","7","","Stem Cell Res Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27650895 PMCID: PMC5028974","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27650895","","Animals; Bone regeneration; Bone Regeneration; Calcium Phosphates; Cell Differentiation; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Exosomes; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; iPS-MSCs; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Microarray; Osteogenesis; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; PI3K/Akt; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Signal Transduction; Skull; Tissue Scaffolds; Tricalcium phosphate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Serum-derived exosomes (SDEs) have been proven to be participated in bone remodeling. However, the molecular changes in SDEs of CPT children and their pathologies have not been elucidated. In this study, SDEs were isolated and purified from CPT patients (CPT-SDEs) associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and normal children (Norm-SDEs). Then we obtained the proteomics profile of SDEs by combining liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and tandem mass tag label-based quantitation. In vitro, the efficacy of SDEs on osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and osteoclastogenesis ability of RAW264.7 cells were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and cytochemical staining. In vivo, we used micro-CT to assess cortical bone mass and trabecular microstructures to reflect the influence of SDEs on bone remodeling after injection into the tail vein of rats. Based on proteomics analysis, 410 differentially expressed proteins, including 289 downregulated proteins and 121 upregulated proteins, were identified in the CPT-SDEs. These proteins have multiple biological functions associated with cellular metabolic processes, catalytic activity, and protein binding, which are important for cell differentiation and proliferation. In vitro, CPT-SDEs decreased the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and promoted the osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 cells. Injection of CPT-SDEs into the tail vein for two months resulted in bone loss in rats, as indicated by the decrease in trabecular and cortical bone mass. Our findings demonstrated the differences in proteins in SDEs between normal and CPT children with NF1. These differentially expressed proteins in CPT-SDEs contributed to deteriorating trabecular bone microstructures by inhibiting bone formation and stimulating bone resorption.","2021-01","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","130-141","","2","246","","Exp Biol Med (Maywood)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33023333 PMCID: PMC7871115","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33023333","","Animals; bone microstructure; Bone Resorption; Cell Line; Child; Child, Preschool; Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia; exosomes; Exosomes; Humans; Male; Mice; Neurofibromatosis 1; osteoblast; osteoclast; Osteogenesis; Pseudarthrosis; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Tibia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, bilayered thiolated alginate/PEG diacrylate (BSSPD) hydrogels were fabricated for sequential release of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), which acted in different wound healing phases, to achieve rapid and scarless wound healing. The sEVs secreted by bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (B-sEVs) were released from the lower layer of the hydrogels to promote angiogenesis and collagen deposition by accelerating fibroblast and endothelial cell proliferation and migration during the early inflammation and proliferation phases, while sEVs secreted by miR-29b-3p-enriched bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells were released from the upper layer of the hydrogels and suppressed excessive capillary proliferation and collagen deposition during the late proliferation and maturation phases. In a full-thickness skin defect model of rats and rabbit ears, the wound repair rate, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition were evaluated at different time points after treatment with BSSPD loaded with B-sEVs. Interestingly, during the end of the maturation phase in the in vivo model, tissues in the groups treated with BSSPD loaded with sEVs for sequential release (SR-sEVs@BSSPD) exhibited a more uniform vascular structure distribution, more regular collagen arrangement, and lower volume of hyperplastic scar tissue than tissues in the other groups. Hence, SR-sEVs@BSSPD based on skin repair phases was successfully designed and has considerable potential as a cell-free therapy for scarless wound healing.","2021-04-27","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","6352-6368","","4","15","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33723994","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723994","","Alginates; Animals; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; Hydrogels; Polyethylene Glycols; Rabbits; Rats; scarless; sequential release; Skin; small extracellular vesicles; thiolated alginate/polyethylene glycol diacrylate hydrogels; wound healing; Wound Healing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the treatment duration is undesirably lengthy, especially in elderly patients. Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-Exos) could exert the beneficial effects while avoiding the possible complications of stem cell transplantation. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of MSC-Exos on bone regeneration during DO in older rats. Exosomes were isolated from the supernatants of young bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) through ultra-centrifugation, and characterized using transmission electron microscopy, western blot, and tunable resistive pulse sensing analysis. The effects of MSC-Exos on the proliferation and differentiation of older BMSCs were evaluated using CCK-8 assay, ALP and ARS staining, and qRT-PCR. Unilateral tibial DO model was established on older Sprague-Dawley rats and MSC-Exos or phosphate buffer saline was locally injected into the distraction gaps after distraction weekly. Bone regeneration were evaluated using X-ray, Micro-CT, mechanical test, and histological staining. The MSC-Exos were round or cup-shaped vesicles ranging from 60 to 130 nm in diameter and expressed markers including CD9, CD63, and TSG101. The in vitro results indicated that MSC-Exos could enhance the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of older BMSCs. Bone regeneration was markedly accelerated in rats treated with MSC-Exos according to the results of X-ray, micro-CT, and histological analysis. The distracted tibias from the MSC-Exos group also demonstrated better mechanical properties. These results suggest that MSC-Exos promote DO-mediated bone regeneration in older rats through enhancing the proliferation and osteogenic capacity of BMSCs.","2020-05","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","509-517","","5","106","","Calcif Tissue Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32103287","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32103287","","Aging; Animals; Bone regeneration; Cell Differentiation; Distraction osteogenesis; Exosomes; Mesenchymal stem cells; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Osteogenesis, Distraction; Osteogenic differentiation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) were co-cultured with human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs), and osteoblastic phenotypes were found to be enhanced in co-cultures compared with monocultures of hDPSCs or hADSCs. Furthermore, GW4869, an inhibitor of extracellular vesicle (EV) formation, suppressed the mineralization of co-cultured cells. Studies indicate that the therapeutic potential of DPSCs is realized through paracrine action, in which EVs play an important role. To study their role, we successfully obtained and identified hDPSC-derived extracellular vesicles (hDPSC-EVs), and further investigated their effects on hADSCs and the underlying mechanism. hADSCs were stimulated with hDPSC-EVs, which were found to promote the migration and mineralization of hADSCs. Moreover, hDPSC-EVs promoted osteogenic differentiation by enhancing the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and JNK in hADSCs. To investigate the specific proteins in EVs that might play a role in hADSC osteogenic differentiation, we performed proteomic analysis of hDPSC-EVs. We determined the top 30 enriched pathways, which notably included the insulin signaling pathway. The number of genes enriched in the insulin signaling pathway was the largest, in addition to the ""protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum"" term. The MAPK cascade is a typical downstream pathway mediating insulin signaling. To further study the effects of hDPSC-EVs on maxillofacial bone regeneration, we used hDPSC-EVs as a cell-free biomaterial in a model of mandibular defects in rats. To assess the therapeutic potential of EVs, we analyzed their proteome. Animal experiments demonstrated that hDPSC-EVs promoted the regeneration of bone defects. Overall, these results highlight the potential of hDPSC-EVs to induce lineage specific differentiation of hADSCs. The results also indicated the importance of considering hDPSC-EVs as biomimetic materials for clinical translation of treatments for oral maxillofacial defects.","2020","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","2041731420975569","","","11","","J Tissue Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33312494 PMCID: PMC7716067","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33312494","","adipose-derived stem cells; bone regeneration; co-culture; Dental pulp stem cells; extracellular vesicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study investigates the capacity of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-secretome, formulated as a ready-to-use and freeze-dried medicinal product (the Lyosecretome), to promote the osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties of titanium cages. In vitro tests were conducted using adipose tissue-derived MSCs seeded on titanium cages with or without Lyosecretome. After 14 days, in the presence of Lyosecretome, significant cell proliferation improvement was observed. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the cytocompatibility of titanium cages: the seeded MSCs showed a spread morphology and an initial formation of filopodia. After 7 days, in the presence of Lyosecretome, more frequent and complex cellular processes forming bridges across the porous surface of the scaffold were revealed. Also, after 14 and 28 days of culturing in osteogenic medium, the amount of mineralized matrix detected by alizarin red was significantly higher when Lyosecretome was used. Finally, improved osteogenesis with Lyosecretome was confirmed by confocal analysis after 28 and 56 days of treatment, and demonstrating the production by osteoblast-differentiated MSCs of osteocalcin, a specific bone matrix protein.","2021-08-06","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","8445","","16","22","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34445150 PMCID: PMC8395097","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34445150","","bone regeneration; Bone Regeneration; Bone Substitutes; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Freeze Drying; Humans; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs); MSC-extracellular vesicles; MSC-secretome; Osteogenesis; Tissue Scaffolds; Titanium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report the pro-osteogenic capacity of exosomes derived from human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) to facilitate bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) differentiation and mineralization. To support their delivery, we engineered a biodegradable polymer delivery platform to improve the encapsulation and the controlled release of exosomes on a tunable time scale from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) triblock copolymer microspheres. Our delivery platform integrates within three-dimensional tissue engineering scaffolds to enable a straightforward surgical insertion into a mouse calvarial defect. We demonstrate the osteogenic potential of these functional constructs in vitro and in vivo. Controlled release of osteogenic hDPSC-derived exosomes facilitates osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, leading to mineralization to a degree which is comparable to exogenous administration of the same exosomes in human and mouse BMSCs. By recruiting endogenous cells to the defects and facilitating their differentiation, the controlled release of osteogenic exosomes from a tissue engineering scaffold demonstrates accelerated bone healing in vivo at 8 weeks. Exosomes recapitulate the advantageous properties of mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells, without manufacturing or immunogenic concerns associated with transplantation of exogenous cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: By means of lentiviral transfection, miR-130a-3p overexpression and knockdown ADSCs were constructed. Alizarin Red S was used to detect the calcium deposits, and qPCR was used to detect osteogenesis-related genes, to verify the effect of miR-130a-3p on the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs. CCK-8 was used to detect the effect of miR-130a-3p on the proliferation of ADSCs. The target binding between miR-130a-3p and SIRT7 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Furthermore, the role of Wnt signalling pathway in the regulation of ADSCs osteogenesis and differentiation by miR-130a-3p was further verified by detecting osteogenic-related genes and proteins and alkaline phosphatase activity. RESULTS: (a) Overexpression of miR-130a-3p can enhance the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs while reducing protein and mRNA levels of SIRT7, a target of miR-130a-3p. (b) Our study further found that overexpression of miR-130a-3p leads to down-regulation of SIRT7 expression with up-regulation of Wnt signalling pathway-associated protein. (c) Overexpression of miR-130a-3p inhibited proliferation of ADSCs, while knockdown promoted it. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained findings indicate that exosomal miR-130a-3p can promote osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs partly by mediating SIRT7/Wnt/β-catenin axis, which will hence promote the application of exosomal microRNA in the field of bone regeneration.","2020-10","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","e12890","","10","53","","Cell Prolif","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32808361 PMCID: PMC7574877","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32808361","","Adipose-derived stem cells; beta Catenin; bone regeneration; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; exosomes; Exosomes; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; MicroRNAs; miR-130a-3p; Osteogenesis; Signal Transduction; Sirtuins; Wnt Proteins; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Wnt/β-catenin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inflammation and decrease in vascularization are key factors in the degeneration of articular cartilage and the associated pain and decrease in function. To combat this process, the use of biologics including umbilical cord-derived Wharton's Jelly (UC-derived WJ) has grown. UC-derived WJ contains large quantities of regenerative factors, including growth factors (GFs), cytokines (CKs), hyaluronic acid (HA), and extracellular vesicles (EVs). The proposed study evaluates the safety and efficacy of intraarticular injection of UC-derived WJ for treatment of knee OA symptoms. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, prospective study in which the safety and efficacy of intraarticular UC-derived WJ in patients suffering from grade II/III OA will be assessed. Twelve patients with grade II/III OA who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited for this study which will be conducted at up to two sites within the USA. The participants will be followed for 1 s. Participants will be assessed using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), 36-item short form survey (SF-36), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), physical exams, plain radiography, and Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score for improvements in pain, satisfaction, function, and cartilage regeneration. DISCUSSION: This prospective study will contribute to the limited amount of data on UC-derived WJ, particularly with regard to its safety and efficacy. The outcomes from this study will also lay the groundwork for a large placebo-controlled trial of intraarticular UC-derived WJ for symptomatic knee OA.

The proangiogenic potential of MSC-MVs was demonstrated by the stimulation of tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. MSC-MVs and osteodifferentiated MSCs were then encapsulated with alginate and seeded onto porous three-dimensional printed PCL scaffolds. When combined with osteodifferentiated MSCs, the MV-alginate-PCL constructs enhanced vessel formation and tissue-engineered bone regeneration in a nude mouse subcutaneous bone formation model, as demonstrated by micro-computed tomographic, histological, and immunohistochemical analyses.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of BMSC-Exos and internal microRNA-210-3p (miRNA-210) on GCS-ONFH in an in vitro hydrocortisone-induced BMECs injury model and an in vivo rat GCS-ONFH model. METHODS: BMECs, BMSCs and BMSC-Exos were isolated and validated. BMECs after the treatment of hydrocortisone were cocultured with different concentrations of BMSC-Exos, then proliferation, migration, apoptosis and angiogenesis of BMECs were evaluated by CCK-8, Annexin V-FITC/PI, cell scratch and tube formation assays. BMSCs were transfected with miRNA-210 mimics and miRNA-210 inhibitors, then BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 mimic and BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 inhibitor secreted from such cells were collected. The differences between BMSC-Exos, BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 mimic and BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 inhibitor in protecting BMECs against GCS treatment were analyzed by methods mentioned above. Intramuscular injections of methylprednisolone were performed on Sprague-Dawley rats to establish an animal model of GCS-ONFH, then tail intravenous injections of BMSC-Exos, BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 mimic or BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 inhibitor were conducted after methylprednisolone injection. Histological and immunofluorescence staining and micro-CT were performed to evaluate the effects of BMSC-Exos and internal miRNA-210 on the in vivo GCS-ONFH model. RESULTS: Different concentrations of BMSC-Exos, especially high concentration of BMSC-Exos, could enhance the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis ability and reduce the apoptosis rates of BMECs treated with GCS. Compared with BMSC-Exos, BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 mimic could further enhance the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis ability and reduce the apoptosis rates of BMECs, while BMECs in the GCS + BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 inhibitor group showed reduced proliferation, migration and angiogenesis ability and higher apoptosis rates. In the rat GCS-ONFH model, BMSC-Exos, especially BMSC-ExosmiRNA-210 mimic, could increase microvascular density and enhance bone remodeling of femoral heads. CONCLUSIONS: BMSC-Exos containing miRNA-210 could serve as potential therapeutics for protecting BMECs and ameliorating the progression of GCS-ONFH.","2023-12-07","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","939","","1","18","","J Orthop Surg Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38062514 PMCID: PMC10704824","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38062514","","Animals; Endothelial Cells; Exosomes; Femur Head; Glucocorticoids; Hydrocortisone; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Methylprednisolone; MicroRNAs; Osteonecrosis; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the DO process is slow, and the consolidation phase is long. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to explore the mechanism of DO, and shorten its duration. Recent studies reported that stem cell exosomes may play an important role in promoting angiogenesis related to DO, but the mechanism remains unclear. METHODS: Canine endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) were isolated and cultured, and the expression of THBS1 in canine ECFCs were inhibited using a lentiviral vector. The exosomes secreted by canine ECFCs were isolated and extracted, and the effect of exosomes on the angiogenic activity of Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was detected by proliferation, migration, and tube formation experiments. WB and qRT-PCR were used to explore the effects and mechanisms of THBS1-mediated ECFC-Exos on HUVECs angiogenesis. Then, a mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) model was established in adult male beagles, and exosomes were injected into the canine peripheral blood. Micro-CT, H&E, Masson, and IHC staining were used to explore the effects and mechanisms of THBS1-mediated ECFC-Exos on angiogenesis and osteogenesis in the DO area. RESULTS: ECFC-Exo accelerated HUVECs proliferation, migration and tube formation, and this ability was enhanced by inhibiting the expression of THBS1 in ECFC-Exo. Using Western blot-mediated detection, we demonstrated that inhibiting THBS1 expression in ECFCs-Exo activated PI3K, AKT, and ERK phosphorylation levels in HUVECs, which promoted VEGF and bFGF expressions. In the DO model of the canine mandible, ECFCs-Exo injected into the peripheral blood aggregated into the DO gap, thus promoting angiogenesis and bone formation in the DO tissue by reducing THBS1 expression in ECFC-Exo. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that ECFC-Exos markedly enhances angiogenesis of endothelial cells, and promotes bone healing in canine MDO. Thus, THBS1 plays a crucial role in the ECFC-Exos-mediated regulation of canine MDO angiogenesis and bone remodeling. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: This study reveals that the angiogenic promotion via THBS1 suppression in ECFC-Exos may be a promising strategy for shortening the DO duration.","2022-11","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","12-22","","","37","","J Orthop Translat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36196150 PMCID: PMC9513111","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36196150","","Angiogenesis; BMD, Bone mineral density; BV/TV, Bone volume to total volume ratio; Distraction osteogenesis; DO, Distraction osteogenesis; ECFC, Canine endothelial colony-forming cell; eEPC, Early endothelial progenitor cell; Endothelial colony-forming cell; EPC, Endothelial progenitor cell; Exosome; HUVEC, Human umbilical vein endothelial cell; IHC, Histological and immunohistochemical; MDO, Mandibular distraction osteogenesis; MNCs, Mononuclear cells; siRNA, Small interfering RNA; Tb.N, Trabecular number; Tb.Sp, Trabecular separation; Tb.Th, Trabecular thickness; TEM, Transmission electron microscope; THBS1, Thrombospondin 1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to identify the presence of exosomes in CME and to determine the osteogenic effect of CME exosomes on MG63 cells. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from human placenta CME using the ExoQuick-TC solution and were characterized. The activity and deposition of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on MG63 cells cultured with or without exosomes in osteogenic induction medium (OIM) were determined. Human amniotic membrane extracts (AME) were used as controls as they had not affected the osteogenic differentiation of MG63 cells in our previous study. RESULTS: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that exosomes isolated from CME and AME (CME-Exo and AME-Exo, respectively) had a cup-shaped structure. NanoSight™ particle tracking analysis (NTA) confirmed that the size of these exosomes was 100-150 nm. In vitro osteogenic experiments demonstrated that the exosomes from CME, but not those from AME, presented increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and resulted in the mineralization of MG63 cells in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Exosomes were identified in CME and AME from the human placenta. Further, the exosomes from CME were found to be capable of promoting osteogenic differentiation, suggesting that exosomes are a key component of CME that stimulate the osteogenesis of human osteoblast-like cells.

The balance between bone matrix formation by mesenchymal lineage osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts is vital for orofacial bone development. Although the mechanisms of orofacial mesenchymal stem cells (OMSCs) in orofacial bone development have been studied intensively, the communication between OMSCs and osteoclasts remains largely unclear. Methods: We used a neural crest cell-specific knockout mouse model to investigate orofacial bone development in GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA4) morphants. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of OMSCs-derived exosomes (OMExos) on osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption activity in vitro. miRNAs were extracted from OMExos, and differences in miRNA abundances were determined using an Affymetrix miRNA array. Luciferase reporter assays were used to validate the binding between GATA4 and miR-206-3p in OMSCs and to confirm the putative binding of miR-206-3p and its target genes in OMSCs and osteoclasts. The regulatory mechanism of the GATA4-miR-206-3p axis in OMSC osteogenic differentiation and osteoclastogenesis was examined in vitro and in vivo. Results: Wnt1-Cre;Gata4fl/fl mice (cKO) not only presented inhibited bone formation but also showed active bone resorption. Osteoclasts cocultured in vitro with cKO OMSCs presented an increased capacity for osteoclastogenesis, which was exosome-dependent. Affymetrix miRNA array analysis showed that miR-206-3p was downregulated in exosomes from shGATA4 OMSCs. Moreover, the transcriptional activity of miR-206-3p was directly regulated by GATA4 in OMSCs. We further demonstrated that miR-206-3p played a key role in the regulation of orofacial bone development by directly targeting bone morphogenetic protein-3 (Bmp3) and nuclear factor of activated T -cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). OMExos and agomiR-206-3p enhanced bone mass in Wnt1-cre;Gata4fl/fl mice by augmenting trabecular bone structure and decreasing osteoclast numbers. Conclusion: Our findings confirm that miR-206-3p is an important downstream factor of GATA4 that regulates the functions of OMSCs and osteoclasts. These results demonstrate the efficiency of OMExos and microRNA agomirs in promoting bone regeneration, which provide an ideal therapeutic tool for orofacial bone deformities in the future.","2021","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","8379-8395","","17","11","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34373748 PMCID: PMC8344011","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34373748","","Animals; Bone Development; Bone Resorption; Cell Differentiation; Exosomes; GATA4 Transcription Factor; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; MicroRNAs; Osteoblasts; Osteoclasts; Osteogenesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These factors can be found in the conditioned medium (CM) collected from cell cultures, and it is believed that extracellular vesicles (EVs) within this CM are at least partially responsible for MPC therapeutic efficacy. This study aimed to examine the functionality of the EV fraction of CM compared to whole CM obtained from human adipose-derived MPCs in an in vivo murine cartilage defect model. Mice treated with whole CM or the EV fraction demonstrated an enhanced cartilage repair score and type II collagen deposition at the injury site compared to saline controls. We then developed a scalable bioprocess using stirred suspension bioreactors (SSBs) to generate clinically relevant quantities of MPC-EVs. Whereas static monolayer culture systems are simple to use and readily accessible, SSBs offer increased scalability and a more homogenous environment due to constant mixing. This study evaluated the biochemical and functional properties of MPCs and their EV fractions generated in static culture versus SSBs. Functionality was assessed using in vitro MPC chondrogenesis as an outcome measure. SSBs supported increased MPC expression of cartilage-specific genes, and EV fractions derived from both static and SSB culture systems upregulated type II collagen production by MPCs. These results suggest that SSBs are an effective platform for the generation of MPC-derived EVs with the potential to induce cartilage repair.","2022-03-03","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","73-87","","1","11","","Stem Cells Transl Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35641171 PMCID: PMC8895489","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35641171","","Animals; bioprocessing; bioreactors; Bioreactors; cartilage; Cartilage, Articular; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Chondrocytes; chondrogenesis; Collagen Type II; Culture Media, Conditioned; exosomes; extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; mesenchymal progenitor cells; mesenchymal stem cells; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Regeneration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Epigenetic regulation through histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition has been shown to increase differentiation capacity. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential of augmenting osteoblast epigenetic functionality using the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of osteoblast-derived EVs for bone regeneration. TSA was found to substantially alter osteoblast epigenetic function through reduced HDAC activity and increased histone acetylation. Treatment with TSA also significantly enhanced osteoblast alkaline phosphatase activity (1.35-fold), collagen production (2.8-fold) and calcium deposition (1.55-fold) during osteogenic culture (P ≤ 0.001). EVs derived from TSA-treated osteoblasts (TSA-EVs) exhibited reduced particle size (1-05-fold) (P > 0.05), concentration (1.4-fold) (P > 0.05) and protein content (1.16-fold) (P ≤ 0.001) when compared to untreated EVs. TSA-EVs significantly enhanced the proliferation (1.13-fold) and migration (1.3-fold) of human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) when compared to untreated EVs (P ≤ 0.05). Moreover, TSA-EVs upregulated hBMSCs osteoblast-related gene and protein expression (ALP, Col1a, BSP1 and OCN) when compared to cells cultured with untreated EVs. Importantly, TSA-EVs elicited a time-dose dependent increase in hBMSCs extracellular matrix mineralisation. MicroRNA profiling revealed a set of differentially expressed microRNAs from TSA-EVs, which were osteogenic-related. Target prediction demonstrated these microRNAs were involved in regulating pathways such as 'endocytosis' and 'Wnt signalling pathway'. Moreover, proteomics analysis identified the enrichment of proteins involved in transcriptional regulation within TSA-EVs. Taken together, our findings suggest that altering osteoblasts' epigenome accelerates their mineralisation and promotes the osteoinductive potency of secreted EVs partly due to the delivery of pro-osteogenic microRNAs and transcriptional regulating proteins. As such, for the first time we demonstrate the potential to harness epigenetic regulation as a novel engineering approach to enhance EVs therapeutic efficacy for bone repair.","2021-07","2024-01-26 18:49:51","2024-01-26 18:49:51","","e12118","","9","10","","J Extracell Vesicles","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34262674 PMCID: PMC8263905","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34262674","","Acetylation; Animals; bone; Bone Marrow Cells; Cells, Cultured; Epigenesis, Genetic; epigenetics; extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Gene Expression Regulation; histone deacetylase; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Histone Deacetylases; Humans; Hydroxamic Acids; Mice; microRNAs; MicroRNAs; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; tissue engineering; trichostatin A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exosomes, derived from mesenchymal stem cells, hold promising potential for cell-free therapy due to multiple abilities, such as promoting proliferation and suppressing apoptosis. We aimed to explore the effect of exosomes derived from adipose mesenchymal stem cell (ADSCs-exo) on osteocyte apoptosis and osteocyte-mediated osteoclastogenesis in vitro. The osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 was used as a model, and apoptosis was induced by hypoxia and serum deprivation (H/SD). Our results showed that ADSCs-exo noticeably reduced H/SD-induced apoptosis in MLO-Y4 cells via upregulating the radio of Bcl-2/Bax, diminishing the production of reactive oxygen species and cytochrome c, and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Additionally, ADSCs-exo lowered the expression of RANKL both at the mRNA and protein levels, as well as the ratio of RANKL/OPG at the gene level. As determined by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, reduced osteoclastogenesis was further validated in bone marrow monocytes cultured under conditioned medium from exosome-treated MLO-Y4.

However, whether exosomes and exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the chemical signals of biomaterials-modulated BMSCs-ECs communication are unknown.

Our results showed that Li-BGC directly promoted the pro-angiogenic capability of HUVECs in vitro and new blood vessel ingrowth in vivo. Moreover, Li-BGC activated Wnt/β-catenin, AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways, while AKT signaling pathway might function as the upstream of Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signaling pathways. More importantly, Li-BGC further facilitated the pro-angiogenic capacity of HUVECs by eliciting the expression of exosomal pro-angiogenic miR-130a in BMSCs-derived exosomes, which subsequently leading to the downregulation of PTEN protein and activation of AKT pathway, ultimately resulting in the elevated proliferation, migration and tube formation of endothelial cells, as well as the upregulated expression of pro-angiogenic genes.

Exosomes are naturally cell-secreted nanovesicles and are lately regraded as an emerging mediator of cellular communication in physiological and pathological conditions. The present study aimed at investigating the complex cellular communications, especially those among the differentiating BMSCs, immune cells (e.g., macrophages), and newly recruited BMSCs via exosome-mediated pathways. Exosomes were first isolated from osteogenically differentiating BMSCs at various stages (Day 0, Day 3, Day 7, and Day 14, respectively). The cellular uptake of isolated exosomes was examined in macrophages and human BMSCs (hBMSCs). The exosomes collected at various osteogenic differentiation stages (0d-exo, 3d-exo, 7d-exo, and 14d-exo) had no effect on the viability of hBMSCs. The uptake of exosomes (0d-exo, 3d-exo, and 7d-exo) significantly decreased proinflammatory-gene expression and the level of an M1 phenotypic marker. Our results then revealed that 3d-exo, 7d-exo, and 14d-exo led to a remarkable increase in mesenchymal stem/stromal cell migration. In addition, 0d-exo significantly promoted the expression of early osteogenic markers, such as alkaline phosphatase and bone morphogenetic protein 2, indicating a pro-osteogenic role of hBMSC-derived exosomes. Collectively, these results suggest that exosomes derived from differentiating mesenchymal stem/stromal cells play a unique osteoimmunomodulatory role in the regulation of bone dynamics.","2019-11","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","1978-1991","","11","13","","J Tissue Eng Regen Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31359542","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\6KK63SJ7\Wei et al. - 2019 - Immunoregulatory role of exosomes derived from dif.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31359542","","Animals; Antigens, Differentiation; Cell Differentiation; exosome; Exosomes; Humans; Immunomodulation; immunoregulation; inflammation; Inflammation; macrophages; Macrophages; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs); Mice; Osteogenesis; osteogenic differentiation; RAW 264.7 Cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In such conditions, mesenchymal progenitor cell populations from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) present advantageous multipotent properties with easy accessibility which makes them a good candidate in both bone and periodontal tissue regeneration. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a functional membranous structure which could participate in multiple cell interactions and imitate the biological functions of their parenting cells largely. To assess their ability to mobilize naïve BMSCs in the bone repair process, Nanosight Tracking Analysis (NTA) and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) were performed to illustrate the composition and functional contents of EV samples derived from SHEDs with different culturing time (24 h, 48 h, and 72 h). Afterwards, the Boyden chamber assay was performed to compare their capacity for mobilizing naïve BMSCs. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post hoc Turkey test was performed for statistical analysis. SHEDs-derived EVs collected from 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h time points, namely, EV24, EV48, and EV72, were mainly secreted as exosomes and tended to reform into smaller size as a result of sonication indicated by NTA results. Moreover, different EV groups were found to be abundant with multiple growth factors including transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) given the detections through ELISA. Boyden chamber assays implied the migratory efficiency of BMSCs driven by EVs at varying concentrations. However, the results showed that migration of BMSCs driven by different EV groups was not statistically significant even with chemotactic factors contained (P > 0.05). Taken together, these data suggest that EVs derived from SHEDs are secreted in functional forms and present a potential of mobilizing naïve BMSCs, which may propose their relevance in assisting bone regeneration.","2021","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","6681771","","","2021","","Stem Cells Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33815511 PMCID: PMC7990532","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\C8KPUXCU\Luo et al. - 2021 - Exploring a Chemotactic Role for EVs from Progenit.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33815511","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we investigated the proangiogenic effects of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by P-DPSCs using in vitro and in vivo testing models. METHODS: Patient-matched DPSCs derived from periodontally healthy teeth (H-DPSCs) were used as the control for P-DPSCs. Conditioned media (CMs) derived from H-DPSCs and P-DPSCs (H-CM and P-CM), CMs derived from both cell types pretreated with the EV secretion blocker GW4869 (H-GW and P-GW), and EVs secreted by H-DPSCs and P-DPSCs (H-EVs and P-EVs) were prepared to test their proangiogenic effects on endothelial cells (ECs). Cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation were assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell/scratch wound healing, and Matrigel assays, respectively. Specifically, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis were used to examine the expression levels of angiogenesis-related genes/proteins in ECs in response to EV-based incubation. Finally, a full-thickness skin defect model was applied to test the effects of EVs on wound healing and new vessel formation. RESULTS: Both H-CM and P-CM promoted EC angiogenesis, but the proangiogenic effects were compromised when ECs were incubated in H-GW and P-GW, wherein the EV secretion was blocked by pretreatment with GW4869. In EV-based incubations, although both H-EVs and P-EVs were found to enhance the angiogenesis-related activities of ECs, P-EVs exerted a more robust potential to stimulate EC proliferation, migration, and tube formation. In addition, P-EVs led to higher expression levels of angiogenesis-related genes/proteins in ECs than H-EVs. Similarly, both P-EVs and H-EVs were found to accelerate wound healing and promote vascularization across skin defects in mice, but wounds treated with P-EVs resulted in a quicker healing outcome and enhanced new vessel formation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study provide additional evidence that P-DPSCs derived from periodontally diseased teeth represent a potential source of cells for research and therapeutic use. Particularly, the proangiogenic effects of P-EVs suggest that P-DPSCs may be used to promote new vessel formation in cellular therapy and regenerative medicine.","2020-03-06","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","110","","1","11","","Stem Cell Res Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32143712 PMCID: PMC7060605","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\TUEDZTYC\Zhou et al. - 2020 - The proangiogenic effects of extracellular vesicle.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32143712","","Angiogenesis; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Dental Pulp; Dental pulp stem cells; Endothelial Cells; Extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Humans; Inflammation; Mice; Periodontitis; Stem Cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, Wharton's jelly (WJ) is an alternative source to bone marrow (BM) for allogeneic transplantation since its isolation does not require an invasive procedure for cell collection and does not raise major ethical concerns. However, the osteogenic capacity of human WJ-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) remains unclear. METHODS: Here, we compared the baseline osteogenic potential of MSC from WJ and BM cell sources by cytological staining, quantitative real-time PCR and proteomic analysis, and assessed chemical and biological strategies for priming undifferentiated WJ-MSC. Concretely, different inhibitors/activators of the TGFβ1-BMP2 signalling pathway as well as the secretome of differentiating BM-MSC were tested. RESULTS: Cytochemical staining as well as gene expression and proteomic analysis revealed that osteogenic commitment was poor in WJ-MSC. However, stimulation of the BMP2 pathway with BMP2 plus tanshinone IIA and the addition of extracellular vesicles or protein-enriched preparations from differentiating BM-MSC enhanced WJ-MSC osteogenesis. Furthermore, greater outcome was obtained with the use of conditioned media from differentiating BM-MSC.

The pathogenesis of GIONFH is still controversial, and abnormal bone metabolism caused by glucocorticoids may be one of the important factors. Exosomes, owing to their positive effect on bone repair, show promising therapeutic effects on bone-related diseases. In this study, we hypothesised that exosomes reduce osteocyte apoptosis in rat GIONFH via the miR-21-PTEN-AKT signalling pathway. Methods: To evaluate the effects of exosomes in GIONFH, a dexamethasone-treated or exosome-treated in vitro cell model and a methylprednisolone-treated in vivo rat model were set up. In vitro, a CCK-8 assay and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine staining were performed to evaluate the proliferation of osteocytes. Further, a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay, annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate-propidium iodide staining, and western blotting were conducted to evaluate the apoptosis of osteocytes. In vivo, we used micro-computed tomography and histological and immunohistochemical analyses to assess the effects of exosomes. Moreover, the mechanism of exosome action on osteocyte apoptosis through the miR-21-PTEN-AKT pathway was investigated by high-throughput RNA sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridisation, luciferase reporter assays, and western blotting. Results: High-throughput RNA sequencing results showed that the AKT signalling pathway was up-regulated in the exosome group. Quantitative PCR and western blotting confirmed that the relative expression of genes in the AKT pathway was up-regulated. Western blotting revealed that AKT activated by exosomes inhibited osteocyte apoptosis. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridisation and luciferase reporter assays were performed to confirm the interaction between miR-21 and PTEN. According to the experiment in vivo, exosomes prevented GIONFH in a rat model as evidenced by micro-computed tomography scanning and histological and immunohistochemical analyses. Conclusions: Exosomes are effective at inhibiting osteocyte apoptosis (in MLO-Y4 cells) and at preventing rat GIONFH.

RNA interference therapy is an emerging epigenetic treatment, and we found that miR-20a could enhance osteogenesis. Moreover, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) were utilized as nanoscale carriers for the protection and transportation of miR-20a (sEV-20a). In this study, we intended to determine whether sEVs overexpressing miR-20a could exert a superior effect on osteoporotic bone defects and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: For evaluating the effect of sEV-20a on osteogenesis, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed. In vitro, we first showed that miR-20a was upregulated in the osteogenic process and overexpressed sEVs with miR-20a by the transfection method. Then, the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation abilities of hBM-MSCs treated with sEV-20a were detected by CCK-8 assays, alkaline phosphatase staining and alizarin red staining, qRT-PCR, and western blot. In vivo, we established an osteoporotic bone defect model and evaluated the effect of sEV-20a on bone formation by micro-CT, sequential fluorescent labeling, and histological analysis. To further explore the mechanism, we applied a bioinformatics method to identify the potential target of miR-20a. RESULTS: In vitro, sEV-20a was successfully established and proved to promote the migration and osteogenesis of hBM-MSCs. In vivo, sEV-20a promoted osteointegration in an osteoporotic rat model. To further elucidate the related mechanism, we proved that miR-20a could enhance osteogenesis by targeting BAMBI.

However, insufficient number of cells and lack of regenerative properties during in vitro expansion still limit the clinical applicability of MSC therapies. Here, we demonstrated a preconditioning strategy with trophoblast stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (TSC-EVs) to boost the proliferation and regenerative capacity of MSCs. METHODS: We employed cell proliferation analyses such as CCK8 and BrdU assays to determine the proliferation-promoting role of TSC-EVs on MSCs. Osteogenic effects of TSC-EVs on MSCs were assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium assays, and calvarial bone defect animal models. For skin regenerative effects, skin wound mice model was exploited to analyze wound-healing rate in this study, as well as immunofluorescence and histological staining evaluates. We also performed the small RNA profiling and RNA-sequencing analyzes to understand the cellular mechanism of TSC-EVs on MSCs. RESULTS: TSC-EVs significantly promoted MSC proliferation under xeno-free conditions and facilitated the therapeutic effects of MSCs, including osteogenesis, anti-senescence, and wound healing. Transcriptomic analysis also provided evidence that specific microRNAs in TSC-EVs and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in TSC-EV-treated MSCs showed the possibility of TSC-EVs triggering the regenerative abilities of MSCs with cytokine interaction. Hence, we found that NGF/Akt signaling mediated the regenerative effects of TSC-EVs on MSCs as a particular cellular signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated the functional properties of TSC-EVs on MSCs for MSC-based therapeutic applications, suggesting that TSC-EVs may serve as a potential preconditioning source for MSC therapy in the clinical field of regenerative medicine.","2023-06-27","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","62","","1","27","","Biomater Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37370189 PMCID: PMC10304624","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\B8N9EUAY\Go et al. - 2023 - Regenerative capacity of trophoblast stem cell-der.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37370189","","Akt pathway; Extracellular vesicles; Mesenchymal stem cells; NGF; Regenerative properties; Trophoblast stem cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC(AT)s) serve as a special source for cell therapy. Herein, we explored whether exosomes (Exo) derived from MSC(AT)s promote primary gingival wound healing and prevent MRONJ. An MRONJ mice model was constructed using zoledronate (Zol) administration and tooth extraction. Exosomes were collected from the conditioned medium (CM) of MSC(AT)s (MSC(AT)s-Exo) and locally administered into the tooth sockets. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA)-siRNA was used to knock down the expression of IL-1RA in MSC(AT)s-Exo. Clinical observations, micro-computed tomography (microCT), and histological analysis were used to evaluate the therapeutic effects in vivo. In addition, the effect of exosomes on the biological behavior of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) was evaluated in vitro. MSC(AT)s-Exo accelerated primary gingival wound healing and bone regeneration in tooth sockets and prevented MRONJ. Moreover, MSC(AT)s-Exo increased IL-1RA expression and decreased interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) expression in the gingival tissue. The sequent rescue assay showed that the effects of preventing MRONJ in vivo and improving the migration and collagen synthesis abilities of zoledronate-affected HGFs in vitro were partially impaired in the IL-1RA-deficient exosome group. Our results indicated that MSC(AT)s-Exo might prevent the onset of MRONJ via an IL-1RA-mediated anti-inflammatory effect in the gingiva wound and improve the migration and collagen synthesis abilities of HGFs.","2023-05-12","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","8694","","10","24","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37240036 PMCID: PMC10218172","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\PQQWKPGI\Zheng et al. - 2023 - Exosomes Derived from Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesen.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37240036","","adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells; Animals; Collagen; exosomes; Exosomes; human gingival fibroblasts; Humans; Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein; interleukin-1 receptor antagonist; medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Osteonecrosis; primary wound healing; X-Ray Microtomography; zoledronate; Zoledronic Acid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies have shown that OCLs exhibit various phenotypes and functions due to variations in the source(s) of precursor cells, cytokine expressions, and microenvironment-dependent factors. During these conditions, inflammatory osteoclasts (iOCLs) lose their immune-suppressive effect relative to OCLs under physiological conditions. This induces TNF α-producing CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner and finally leads to cascade amplification of iOCLs. OCL-derived exosomes have been reported to regulate OCL formation and inhibit the osteoblast activity. However, the specific function and mechanism of iOCL-derived exosomes on osteoblast have not been studied yet. In the present study, we compare the osteoblast promoting activities of iOCL-derived exosomes and OCL-derived exosomes. We found that iOCLs exosomes specifically target osteoblasts through ephrinA2/EphA2. Mechanistically, the lncRNA LIOCE is enriched in iOCL exosomes and promotes the osteoblast activity after being incorporated into osteoblasts. Furthermore, our results revealed that exosomal lncRNA LIOCE stabilizes osteogenic transcription factor Osterix by interacting and reducing the ubiquitination level of Osterix. This study demonstrated that the bone loss is alleviated in the inflammatory osteolysis mice model after injection of iOCL exosomes encapsulating lncRNA LIOCE. The role of exosomes encapsulating lncRNA LIOCE in promoting bone formation was well established in the rat bone repair model. Our results indicate that iOCL-derived exosomal lncRNA LIOCE promotes bone formation by upregulating Osx expression, and thus, the exosomes encapsulating lncRNA LIOCE may be an effective strategy to increase bone formation in osteoporosis and other bone metabolic disorders.","2022-02","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","e22115","","2","36","","FASEB J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35032415","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35032415","","3T3 Cells; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; exosomes; Exosomes; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Inflammation; inflammatory osteoclasts; lncRNA; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; osteoblasts; Osteoblasts; Osteoclasts; Osteogenesis; Osteolysis; Osteoporosis; Rats; RNA, Long Noncoding; Sp7 Transcription Factor; Transcription Factors; Ubiquitination; Up-Regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exosomes are a type of microvesicles (MVs) that may play a role in tissue-tissue and cell-cell communication in homeostasis and diseases. We hypothesized that exosomes function in a novel regulatory network that contributes to OA pathogenesis and examined the function of exosomes in communication among joint tissue cells. METHODS: Human synovial fibroblasts (SFB) and articular chondrocytes were obtained from normal knee joints. Exosomes isolated from conditioned medium of SFB were analyzed for size, numbers, markers and function. Normal articular chondrocytes were treated with exosomes from SFB, and Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) stimulated SFB. OA-related genes expression was quantified using real-time PCR. To analyze exosome effects on cartilage tissue, we performed glycosaminoglycan release assay. Angiogenic activity of these exosomes was tested in migration and tube formation assays. Cytokines and miRNAs in exosomes were analyzed by Bio-Plex multiplex assay and NanoString analysis. RESULTS: Exosomes from IL-1β stimulated SFB significantly up-regulated MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 expression in articular chondrocytes, and down-regulated COL2A1 and ACAN compared with SFB derived exosomes. Migration and tube formation activity were significantly higher in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with the exosomes from IL-1β stimulated SFB, which also induced significantly more proteoglycan release from cartilage explants. Inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, MMP-3 and VEGF in exosomes were only detectable at low level. IL-1β, TNFα MMP-9 and MMP-13 were not detectable in exosomes. NanoString analysis showed that levels of 50 miRNAs were differentially expressed in exosomes from IL-1β stimulated SFB compared to non-stimulated SFB. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes from IL-1β stimulated SFB induce OA-like changes both in vitro and in ex vivo models. Exosomes represent a novel mechanism by which pathogenic signals are communicated among different cell types in OA-affected joints.","2014-08-04","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","R163","","4","16","","Arthritis Res Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25092378 PMCID: PMC4261911","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\ZEVITKJE\Kato et al. - 2014 - Exosomes from IL-1β stimulated synovial fibroblast.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092378","","Cartilage, Articular; Chondrocytes; Exosomes; Fibroblasts; Humans; Immunoblotting; Interleukin-1beta; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Osteoarthritis; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Synovial Membrane","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasing numbers of studies have demonstrated that exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells, especially adipose-derived stem cells, have key roles in stem cell-based therapies by accelerating bone remodeling, facilitating angiogenesis, and promoting wound healing. We hypothesized that exosomes derived from adipose-derived stem cells can prevent MRONJ by accelerating gingival healing and enhancing bone remodeling processes. Our results may provide a promising therapeutic option for MRONJ clinical therapy.","2021-03-10","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","e929684","","","27","","Med Sci Monit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33690263 PMCID: PMC7958499","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\M69W6GRQ\Dong et al. - 2021 - Exosomes from Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Can Preve.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33690263","","Adipocytes; Adipose Tissue; Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw; Bone Remodeling; Exosomes; Gingiva; Humans; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Wound Healing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we investigated the effects of secretion factors of human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) on osteogenesis of human bone marrow derived MSCs (hBMSCs). The results showed that 20 μg/ml hUCMSCs secretion factors could initiate osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs without osteogenic induction medium (OIM), and the amount of calcium deposit (stained by Alizarin Red) was significantly increased after the hUCMSCs secretion factors treatment. Real time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real time qRT-PCR) demonstrated that the expression of osteogenesis-related genes including ALP, BMP2, OCN, Osterix, Col1α and Runx2 were significantly up-regulated following hUCMSCs secretion factors treatment. In addition, we found that 10 μg hUCMSCs secretion factors together with 2×10(5) hBMSCs in the HA/TCP scaffolds promoted ectopic bone formation in nude mice. Local application of 10 μg hUCMSCs secretion factors with 50 μl 2% hyaluronic acid hydrogel and 1×10(5) rat bone marrow derived MSCs (rBMSCs) also significantly enhanced the bone repair of rat calvarial bone critical defect model at both 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Moreover, the group that received the hUCMSCs secretion factors treatment had more cartilage and bone regeneration in the defect areas than those in the control group. Taken together, these findings suggested that hUCMSCs secretion factors can initiate osteogenesis of bone marrow MSCs and promote bone repair. Our study indicates that hUCMSCs secretion factors may be potential sources for promoting bone regeneration.","2015","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","e0120593","","3","10","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25799169 PMCID: PMC4370627","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\EZNUJDD4\Wang et al. - 2015 - The effects of secretion factors from umbilical co.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25799169","","Animals; Antigens, Surface; Autocrine Communication; Biomarkers; Bone Regeneration; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Differentiation; Humans; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Mice, Nude; Osteogenesis; Phenotype; Rats; Umbilical Cord","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using this method, the amount of human adipose-derived stem cell-EVs (hASC-EVs) anchored onto the Bio-Ppy-Ti surface was 185-fold higher than that of pure Ti after ultrasonic concussion for 30 s and it remained stable on the Bio-Ppy-Ti surface for 14 days at 4 °C. Compared to pristine Ti, EV-Bio-Ppy-Ti exhibited enhanced cell compatibility and osteoinductivity for osteoblasts in vitro and anti-apoptosis ability in the ectopic bone formation mode. Gene chip analysis further demonstrated that several osteoinductive miRNAs were encapsulated in hASC-EVs, which may explain the high bone regeneration ability of EV-Bio-Ppy-Ti.

Nevertheless, the interactions between macrophages and PDLSCs in OTM remain to be investigated. Consequently, the present study was proposed to explore the effect of different polarization states of macrophages on the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. METHODS: After M0, M1 and M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (M0-exo, M1-exo and M2-exo) treatment of primary cultured human PDLSCs, respectively, mineralized nodules were observed by Alizarin red S staining, and the expression of ALP and OCN mRNA and protein were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, correspondingly. Identification of differentially expressed microRNAs (DE-miRNA) in M0-exo and M2-exo by miRNA microarray, and GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of DE-miRNA targets, and construction of protein-protein interaction networks. RESULTS: M2-exo augmented mineralized nodule formation and upregulated ALP and OCN expression in PDLSCs, while M0-exo had no significant effect. Compared to M0-exo, a total of 52 DE-miRNAs were identified in M2-exo. The expression of hsa-miR-6507-3p, hsa-miR-4731-3p, hsa-miR-4728-3p, hsa-miR-3614-5p and hsa-miR-6785-3p was significantly down-regulated, and the expression of hsa-miR-6085, hsa-miR-4800-5p, hsa-miR-4778-5p, hsa-miR-6780b-5p and hsa-miR-1227-5p was significantly up-regulated in M2-exo compared to M0-exo. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the downstream targets of DE-miRNAs were mainly involved in the differentiation and migration of multiple cells. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we have indicated for the first time that M2-exo can promote osteogenic differentiation of human PDLSCs, and have revealed the functions and pathways involved in the DE-miRNAs of M0-exo and M2-exo and their downstream targets.","2022-12-27","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","647","","1","22","","BMC Oral Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36575449 PMCID: PMC9795719","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\M9DD2PQF\Liao et al. - 2022 - Comprehensive analysis of M2 macrophage-derived ex.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36575449","","Cell Differentiation; Exosome, microRNA; Exosomes; Humans; Macrophage polarization; Macrophages; MicroRNAs; Orthodontic tooth movement; Osteogenesis; Periodontal Ligament; Periodontal ligament stem cells; Stem Cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alleviating LI by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (BMSCs-Exos) and microRNAs (miRs) has been previously reported. This study is devised to probe the interaction between BMSCs-Exos and miR-425 in HILI. METHODS: Firstly, BMSCs-Exos were isolated and identified. Then, HILI rat models and RLE-6TN cell models were successfully established and treated by BMSCs-Exos. Afterwards, functional assays were conducted to explore cell biological behaviors in models, with miR-425 expression detected. Then, the target relation between miR-425 and PTEN was clarified by luciferase reporter assay. Eventually, expression of PTEN and the PI3K/Akt axis was assessed by Western blotting and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: BMSCs-Exos promoted miR-425 expression and attenuated HILI and H2O2 induced RLE-6TN cell injury as evidence by alleviated lung cell injury, decreased TUNEL-positive cells, induced cell viability and declined apoptosis (all p < 0.05). Besides, when miR-425 was knocked-down, the protective role of BMSCs-Exos in HILI was also reduced (all p < 0.05). miR-425 targeted PTEN mRNA, whose upregulation reversed the protective role of BMSCs-Exos in HILI (all p < 0.05). BMSCs-Exos improved the quenched levels of the PI3K/AKT axis in HILI (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our data supported that miR-425 in BMSCs-Exos inhibits HILI by targeting PTEN and upregulating the PI3K/AKT axis.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) plays a critical role in bone development. However, HIF-1α is easily biodegradable under normoxic conditions. The bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were transfected with adenovirus carrying triple point-mutations (amino acids 402, 564, and 803) in the HIF-1α coding sequence (CDS). The mutant HIF-1α can efficiently express functional proteins under normoxic conditions. To date, no study has reported the role of exosomes secreted by mutant HIF-1α modified BMSCs in the recovery of the early steroid-induced avascular necrosis of femoral head (SANFH). In this study, we firstly analyzed exosomes derived from BMSCs modified by mutant (BMSC-ExosMU ) or wild-type HIF-1α (BMSC-ExosWT ). In vitro, we investigated the osteogenic differentiation capacity of BMSCs modified by BMSC-ExosMU or BMSC-ExosWT , and the angiogenesis effects of BMSC-ExosMU and BMSC-ExosWT on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Besides, the healing of the femoral head was also assessed in vivo. We found that the potential of osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs treated with BMSC-ExosMU was higher than the wild-type group in vitro. In addition, BMSC-ExosMU stimulated the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with the BMSC-ExosWT or PBS control group, the injection of BMSC-ExosMU into the necrosis region markedly accelerated the bone regeneration and angiogenesis, which were indicated by the increased trabecular reconstruction and microvascular density. Taken together, our data suggest that BMSC-ExosMU facilitates the repair of SANFH by enhancing osteogenesis and angiogenesis.","2017-12","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","1379-1390","","12","41","","Cell Biol Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28877384","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28877384","","ALP; Animals; Bone Marrow Cells; bone regeneration; Bone Regeneration; Cell Differentiation; exosomes; Exosomes; Femur Head Necrosis; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; neovascularization; Neovascularization, Physiologic; OCN; Osteogenesis; Rabbits; SANFH; Transfection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cell recruitment and clearance are the mechanisms by which osteoclast populations are regulated. Research in other tissues has revealed that many cells die after their functional lives are past by a process called apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of apoptosis in osteoclast clearance at orthodontically treated sites as a function of time and location. Orthodontic appliances were placed on 96 rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain. The rats were assigned to either treatment or sham (control) groups and killed 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after appliance placement. Tissue samples were prepared for histochemical evaluation and quantification of morphologic features. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and ApopTag (TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick 3' end labeling) stains were used to identify osteoclasts and committed preosteoclasts and to discriminate between apoptotic and nonapoptotic nuclei. Pyknotic nuclei and apoptotic bodies were also counted as a morphologic assessment of apoptosis. The percentages of TRAP/ApopTag-positive nuclei were measured in 4 different periodontal regions. There was a highly significant difference in the overall percentage of TRAP/ApopTag-positive nuclei between the control and the treatment groups at 3, 5, and 7 days (P <.001). Morphologic criteria were also statistically different at days 5 and 7 (P <.05).

In the current study, to investigate the differentiation effects of human articular chondrocyte EVs on adipose-derived MSCs, they were cultured in injectable chitosan-hyaluronic acid (CS-HA) hydrogel and then treated with chondrocyte EVs for 21 days. The continuous treatment of EVs performed on MSCs increased chondrogenic genes' expressions ofSOX9andCOL2A1and induced expression of Col II protein. In addition, glycosaminoglycans secretion was detected in the EV-treated MSCs after about 14 days. The therapeutic efficiency of this hydrogel and EVs was studied in a rabbit osteochondral defect model. MRI results revealed that the cartilage regeneration capacity of EV-treated MSCs with CS-HA hydrogel was greater than the untreated MSCs or the EV-treated MSCs without hydrogel. Moreover, histological results showed hyaline-like cartilage in the CS-HA/MSC and CS-HA/EV/MSC groups in the cartilage defect sites.

Part A","","1552-4965","10.1002/jbm.a.37600","","The increasing prevalence of bone-related diseases has raised concern about the need for an osteoinductive and mechanically stronger scaffold-based bone tissue engineering (BTE) alternative. A mineralized microenvironment, similar to the native bone microenvironment, is required in the scaffold to recruit and differentiate local mesenchymal stem cells at the bone defect site. Further, extracellular vesicles (EVs), pre-osteoblasts' secretome, contain osteoinductive cargo and have recently been exploited in bone regeneration. This work developed a cell-free and mechanically strong interpenetrating network-based scaffold for BTE by combining the action of osteoinductive EVs with a mineralized microenvironment. The MC3T3 (a pre-osteoblast cell line) is used as a source of EVs and as the target population. The optimal concentration of MC3T3-EVs was first determined to induce osteogenesis in target cells. The osteoinductive potential of the scaffold was estimated in vitro by osteogenesis-related markers like the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme and calcium content. The MC3T3-EVs cargo was also studied for osteoinductive signals such as ALP, calcium, and mRNA. The findings of this work indicated that MC3T3-EVs at a 90 μg/mL dose had significantly higher ALP activity than 0 μg/mL (1.47-fold), 10 μg/mL (1.41-fold), and 30 μg/mL (1.39-fold) EV-concentration on day 14. Further combination of the optimum dose of EVs with a mineralized microenvironment significantly enhanced ALP activity (1.5-fold) and mineralization (3.36-fold) as compared to the control group on day 7. EV cargo analysis revealed the presence of calcium, the ALP enzyme, and the mRNAs necessary for osteogenesis and angiogenesis. ALP activity was significantly boosted in the EV-containing target cells as early as day 1, and mineralization began on day 7 because MC3T3-EVs carry ALP enzymes and calcium as cargo. When osteoinductive EVs were combined with an osteoconductive mineralized microenvironment, osteogenesis was significantly enhanced in target cells at early time points. The interaction between osteoinductive EVs and the mineralized milieu facilitates the process of osteogenesis in the target cells and suggests a potential cell-free strategy for in vivo bone repair.","2024-02","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","155-166","","2","112","","J Biomed Mater Res A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37671776","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37671776","","Bone and Bones; Calcium; Cell Differentiation; extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; hydroxyapatite; mineralized microenvironment; Osteoblasts; osteoconduction; Osteogenesis; osteoinduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Microvesicles (MVs) have received a good deal of attention and are increasingly considered as mediators of intercellular communication due to their capacity to merge with and transfer a repertoire of bioactive molecular content (cargo) to recipient cells, triggering a variety of biologic responses. Here, we demonstrated that MVs shed from osteoblasts contain RANKL protein and can transfer it to osteoclast precursors through receptor ligand (RANKL-RANK), leading to stimulation of RANKL-RANK signaling to facilitate osteoclast formation. Such MV-mediated intercellular communication between osteoblasts and osteoclasts may represent a novel mechanism of bone modeling and remodeling. It may be worthwhile to further explore MVs as tools to modify the biological responses of bone cells or develop an alternative drug to treat bone diseases.","2015-10","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","37-42","","","79","","Bone","Osteoblast-derived microvesicles","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26013558","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26013558","","Animals; Blotting, Western; Bone Remodeling; Cell Communication; Cell Line; Cell-Derived Microparticles; Cellular communication; Flow Cytometry; Mice; Microscopy, Confocal; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Microvesicles; Osteoblast; Osteoblasts; Osteoclast; Osteoclasts; RANK Ligand; RANKL–RANK pathway","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, a novel method to promote diabetic wound healing is of considerable interest at present. Previous studies showed that injection of MSC-derived exosomes has beneficial effects on wound healing. In current studies, we aimed to isolate exosomes derived from gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) and then loading them to the chitosan/silk hydrogel sponge to evaluate the effects of this novel non-invasive method on skin defects in diabetic rats. Methods: GMSCs were isolated from human gingival connective tissue and characterized by surface antigen analysis and in vitro multipotent differentiation. The cell supernatant was collected to isolate the exosomes. The exosomes were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Western blot and size distribution analysis. The chitosan/silk-based hydrogel sponge was prepared using the freeze-drying method and then structural and physical properties were characterized. Then, the exosomes were added to the hydrogel and tested in a diabetic rat skin defect model. The effects were evaluated by wound area measurement, histological, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis. Results: We have successfully isolated GMSCs and exosomes with a mean diameter of 127 nm. The chitosan/silk hydrogel had the appropriate properties of swelling and moisture retention capacity. The in vivo studies showed that the incorporating of GMSC-derived exosomes to hydrogel could effectively promote healing of diabetic skin defects. The histological analysis revealed more neo-epithelium and collagen in the hydrogel-exosome group. In addition, the hydrogel-exosome group had the highest microvessel density and nerve density. Conclusions: The combination of GMSC-derived exosomes and hydrogel could effectively promote skin wound healing in diabetic rats by promoting the re-epithelialization, deposition and remodeling of collagen and by enhancing angiogenesis and neuronal ingrowth. These findings not only provide new information on the role of the GMSC-derived exosomes in wound healing but also provide a novel non-invasive application method of exosomes with practical value for skin repair.","2017","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","904","","","8","","Front Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29163228 PMCID: PMC5681946","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\D7J6N6M5\Shi et al. - 2017 - GMSC-Derived Exosomes Combined with a ChitosanSil.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29163228","","diabetic rats; exosomes; gingival mesenchymal stem cells; hydrogel sponge; skin repair and regeneration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The OPN protein is cleaved, but it is unclear how full-length (FL)-OPN or its cleaved form perform their biological activities in target cells. We, therefore, performed the molecular characterization of OPN in exosomes (Exo). The Exo were isolated from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 macrophages. The Exo were also isolated from PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages. The Exo were identified using the qNano multiple analyzer (diameter 59-315 nm) and western blotting with a CD9 antibody. LPS-stimulated cells produced more particles than non-stimulated cells. The presence of the FL or the cleaved form of OPN was confirmed using western blot analysis. A mixture of FL and cleaved OPN was also measured using an ELISA system (Ud-OPN) and their presence in the Exo was confirmed. Ud/FL ratios became low after LPS stimulation, indicating the enhanced encapsulation of FL-OPN in the Exo by LPS. These findings suggest that LPS stimulation of human macrophages facilitates the synthesis of FL-OPN, which is cleaved in cells or the Exo after release. These findings indicate that Exo is a suitable vehicle to transfer OPN to the target cells.","2020-11-11","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","8490","","22","21","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33187327 PMCID: PMC7696453","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\5GQPGMF4\Bai et al. - 2020 - Stimulation of THP-1 Macrophages with LPS Increase.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33187327","","Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Exo-Prep; exosome; Exosomes; Humans; Lipopolysaccharides; LPS; Macrophages; osteopontin; Osteopontin; Phosphorylcholine; Polymethacrylic Acids; THP-1; THP-1 Cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, fusion peptide-mediated EVs are able to modify the surface of the SIS membrane via specific combination. In vitro studies prove that modified SIS membranes can promote cell migration and spreading. This phenomenon may be because of the activation of TEADs, which regulate cell behavior. By constructing a rat abdominal wall defect model, it is further demonstrated that the modified SIS membrane is more conducive to tissue regeneration.

RESULTS: In this study, a stem cell-mediated gene therapy strategy is developed in which mediator mesenchymal stem cells are genetically engineered by bone morphogenetic protein-2 gene to produce exosomes (MSC-BMP2-Exo) with enhanced bone regeneration potency. This effect is attributed to the synergistic effect of the content derived from MSCs and the up-regulated BMP2 gene expression. The MSC-BMP2-Exo also present homing ability to the injured site. The toxic effect of genetical transfection vehicles is borne by mediator MSCs, while the produced exosomes exhibit excellent biocompatibility. In addition, by plasmid tracking, it is interesting to find a portion of plasmid DNA can be encapsulated by exosomes and delivered to recipient cells.

This study aims to investigate the efficacy of exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on the pathogenesis and behavioral signs of LBP in the LFJ OA mouse model. The pathogenetic change in cartilage and aberrant nerve invasion in the subchondral bone of LFJ in a mouse model after treatment with BMSC-exosomes was evaluated. BMSC-exosomes could relieve pain via abrogation of aberrant CGRP-positive nerve and abnormal H-type vessel formation in the subchondral bone of LFJ.

Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have been considered as a potentially promising treatment for osteoporosis. However, the therapeutic effect, genetic alterations, and in vivo behavior of exogenous EVs for osteoporosis in mice models remain poorly understood. METHODS: A multiplexed molecular imaging strategy was constructed by micro-positron emission tomography (µPET)/computed tomography (CT), µCT, and optical imaging modality which reflected the osteoblastic activity, microstructure, and in vivo behavior of EVs, respectively. RNA sequencing was used to analyze the cargo of EVs, and the bone tissues of ovariectomized (OVX) mice post EV treatment. RESULTS: The result of [18F]NaF µPET showed an increase in osteoblastic activity in the distal femur of EV-treated mice, and the bone structural parameters derived from µCT were also improved. In terms of in vivo behavior of exogenous EVs, fluorescent dye-labeled EVs could target the distal femur of mice, whereas the uptakes of bone tissues were not significantly different between OVX mice and healthy mice. RNA sequencing demonstrated upregulation of ECM-related genes, which might associate with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, in line with the results of microRNA analysis showing that mir-21, mir-29, mir-221, and let-7a were enriched in Wharton's jelly-MSC-EVs and correlated to the BMP and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic effect of exogenous WJ-MSC-EVs in the treatment of osteoporosis was successfully assessed by a multiplexed molecular imaging strategy. The RNA sequencing demonstrated the possible molecular targets in the regulation of bone remodeling. The results highlight the novelty of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of EV-based treatment for osteoporosis.","2021","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","7813-7830","","","16","","Int J Nanomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34880610 PMCID: PMC8646890","","C:\Users\trent\Zotero\storage\M7W75I99\Lu et al. - 2021 - Multiplexed Molecular Imaging Strategy Integrated .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34880610","","[18F]NaF; Animals; extracellular vesicles; Extracellular Vesicles; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; MicroRNAs; Molecular Imaging; osteoporosis; Osteoporosis; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; RNA sequencing; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Wharton Jelly; Wharton’s jelly mesenchymal stem cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results of Gene Ontology analysis and pathway analysis demonstrated that the target genes of differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs participate in the regulation of a variety of biological processes, such as catalytic activity, protein binding, metabolic processes, cell development, and differentiation, and are enriched in osteogenic differentiation-related pathways, such as MAPK signaling, AMPK signaling, and insulin signaling pathways.

In contrast to the prevailing view that monocytes/macrophages orchestrate mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and progenitor cells via the secretion of soluble factors, we examined whether communication between these different cell types also occurs via exosomes. LPS-stimulated human monocytes released exosomes, positive for CD9, CD63, CD81, Tsg101 and Hsp70, as determined by flow cytometry and Western blot. These exosomes also contained wide size distribution of RNA, including RNA in the size of microRNAs. The exosomes were shown to interact with human mesenchymal stem cells. After 24 h of culture, a considerable portion of the MSCs had internalised PKH67-labelled exosomes. Furthermore, after 72 h, the gene expression of the osteogenic markers runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) had increased in comparison with control medium, whereas no significant difference in osteocalcin (OC) expression was demonstrated. The present results show that, under given experimental conditions, monocytes communicate with MSCs via exosomes, resulting in the uptake of exosomes in MSCs and the stimulation of osteogenic differentiation.

Consequently, bone regeneration using mesenchymal stem cells and tissue engineering strategies is one of the most widely researched fields in regenerative medicine. Recent scientific consensus indicates that a biomimetic approach is required to achieve proper regeneration of any tissue. Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted by cells that act as messengers that influence cell fate. Although exosomal function has been studied with respect to cancer and immunology, the role of exosomes as inducers of stem cell differentiation has not been explored. We hypothesized that exosomes can be used as biomimetic tools for regenerative medicine. In this study we have explored the use of cell-generated exosomes as tools to induce lineage specific differentiation of stem cells. Our results indicate that proosteogenic exosomes isolated from cell cultures can induce lineage specific differentiation of naïve MSCs in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, exosomes can also bind to matrix proteins such as type I collagen and fibronectin enabling them to be tethered to biomaterials. Overall, the results from this study show the potential of cell derived exosomes in bone regenerative medicine and opens up new avenues for future research.","2016","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","3808674","","","2016","","Stem Cells Int","Hijacking the Cellular Mail","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26880957 PMCID: PMC4736778","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26880957","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, to the best of our knowledge, there are currently no studies investigating the role of osteocyte-secreted exosomes. In the present study, ablation of osteocytes in mice [osteocyte-less (OL)] was used to examine the microRNA (miRNA) levels of plasma-circulating exosomes. In order to investigate the function of osteocyte-secreted exosomes, exosomes derived from MLO-Y4 cells were extracted and their miRNA expression levels were examined using miRNA array analysis and deep sequencing. Comparison of miRNA expression levels between plasma exosomes from OL mouse plasma and MLO-Y4-derived exosomes revealed that decreases in the number of miRNAs from exosomes circulating in the OL mouse plasma may be caused by a decrease in secretion of exosomes from osteocytes. These results suggest that osteocytes secrete exosomes containing characterized miRNAs and then circulate in the blood, and may thus transfer their components, including miRNAs, to recipient cells where they function as signaling molecules in other organs and/or tissues to regulate biological responses.","2017-02","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","223-231","","2","6","","Biomed Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28357077 PMCID: PMC5351302","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28357077","","circulating exosome; exosome; microRNA; osteocyte","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we investigated the proteome of EVs from clastic cells plated on plastic (clasts), bone (osteoclasts) and dentin (odontoclasts) by two-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry seeking differences attributable to distinct mineralized matrices. A total of 1,952 proteins were identified. Of the 500 most abundant proteins in EVs, osteoclast and odontoclast EVs were 83.3% identical, while clasts shared 70.7% of the proteins with osteoclasts and 74.2% of proteins with odontoclasts. For each protein, the differences between the total ion count values were mapped to an expression ratio histogram (Z-score) in order to detect proteins differentially expressed. Stabilin-1 and macrophage mannose receptor-1 were significantly-enriched in EVs from odontoclasts compared with osteoclasts (Z = 2.45, Z = 3.34) and clasts (Z = 13.86, Z = 1.81) and were abundant in odontoclast EVs. Numerous less abundant proteins were differentially-enriched. Subunits of known protein complexes were abundant in clastic EVs, and were present at levels consistent with them being in assembled protein complexes. These included the proteasome, COP1, COP9, the T complex and a novel sub-complex of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), which included the (pro) renin receptor. The (pro) renin receptor was immunoprecipitated using an anti-E-subunit antibody from detergent-solubilized EVs, supporting the idea that the V-ATPase subunits present were in the same protein complex. We conclude that the protein composition of EVs released by clastic cells changes based on the substrate. Clastic EVs are enriched in various protein complexes including a previously undescribed V-ATPase sub-complex.","2019","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","e0219602","","7","14","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31291376 PMCID: PMC6619814","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291376","","Animals; Bone Marrow Cells; Bone Remodeling; Cells, Cultured; Extracellular Vesicles; Mice; Osteoclasts; Osteogenesis; Primary Cell Culture; Proteome; Proteomics; Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current research on the mechanism of stem cells on the repair of damaged tissue suggest an important role of a cell-to-cell communication through secreted extracellular vesicles, mainly represented by exosomes. To enhance the scarce knowledge on the functional role of exosomes we compared as a first step different techniques to isolate and identify exosomes from the supernatant of equine adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells for further characterization and usage in functional assays. RESULTS: It was possible to obtain exosomes secreted from equine adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells with three common techniques: a stepwise ultracentrifugation at 100.000 g, an ultrafiltration with 3 kDa exclusion membranes and a charge-based precipitation method. The mean sizes and amounts of exosomes isolated with the different techniques were measured by the nanoparticle tracking analysis. The diameter ranged between 116.2 nm (ultracentrifugation), 453.1 nm (precipitation) and 178.7 nm (ultrafiltration), the counts of particles / ml ranged between 9.6 × 108 (ultracentrifugation), 2.02 × 109 (precipitation) and 52.5 × 109 (ultrafiltration). Relevant marker for exosomes, tetraspanins CD9, CD63 and CD81 were detectable by immunofluorescence staining of the investigated exosomes secreting mesenchymal stem cells. In addition, transmission electron microscopy and immunogold labeling with CD9 and CD90 was performed to display the morphological shape of exosomes and existence of marker relevant for exosomes (CD9) and mesenchymal stem cells (CD90). Western blot analysis of CD9 and CD90 of exosomes ensured the specificity of the rare available respectively cross reacting antibodies against equine antigens. CONCLUSION: Exosomes generated by equine mesenchymal stem cells can be obtained by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation in an equal quality for in vitro experiments. Especially for later therapeutic usage we recommend ultrafiltration due to a higher concentration without aggregation of extracellular vesicles in comparison to exosomes obtained by ultracentrifugation.","2019-01-28","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","42","","1","15","","BMC Vet Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30691449 PMCID: PMC6348641","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691449","","Animals; Cytological Techniques; Equine mesenchymal stem cells; Exosomes; Horses; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Nanoparticle tracking analysis; Stem cells; Ultrafiltration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The underlying mechanisms were also explored. METHODS: EPCs were isolated from bone marrow mononuclear cells. EPC-MVs were collected from EPCs cultured medium. The lentivirus was used to induce miR-126 over-expression in EPCs and EPC-MVs. miR-126 expression was detected by qRT-PCR. The proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation abilities of osteoblast cells MC3T3-E1 were analysed in the presence or absence of EPC-MVs or miR-126 overexpressed EPC-MVs (EPC-MVs-miR126). The proteins of Erk1/2 and Bcl-2 were analysed by western blot. Erk1/2 inhibitor was used for pathway exploration. RESULTS: EPC-MVs reduced apoptosis and promoted proliferation and migration of MC3T3-E1 cells, which could be enhanced by miR-126 enrichment (p< 0.05). Neither EPC-MVs nor EPC-MVs-miR126 had an effect on MC3T3-E1 cell osteogenic differentiation (p> 0.05). EPC-MVs-miR126 had better effects than EPC-MVs on upregulating the expressions of p-Erk1/2 and Bcl-2, which were abolished by Erk1/2 inhibitor. ERK1/2-Bcl-2 activity plays a crucial role in the regulation of EPC-MVs/EPC-MVs-miR126 on the effect of MC3T3-E1 cells. CONCLUSION: EPC-MVs promote proliferation and migration of MC3T3-E1 cell while reduced apoptosis via the miR-126/Erk1/2-Bcl-2 pathway.

To overcome these drawbacks, exosomes (EXOs) derived from MSCs have been recently proposed as a cell-free alternative to MSCs to direct tissue regeneration. It was hypothesized that there is a correlation between the biological properties of exosomes derived from the dental pulp and the age of the donor. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of EXOs derived from dental pulp stem cells of permanent teeth (old donor group) or exfoliated deciduous teeth (young donor group) on MSCs cultured in vitro. Proliferation potential was evaluated by doubling time, and commitment ability by gene expression and biochemical quantification for tissue-specific factors. Results showed a well-defined proliferative influence for the younger donor aged group. Similarly, a higher commitment ability was detected in the young group. In conclusion, EXOs could be employed to promote bone regeneration, likely playing an important role in neo-angiogenesis in early healing phases.","2022-04-21","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","908","","5","14","","Pharmaceutics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35631496 PMCID: PMC9146046","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35631496","","bone regeneration; dental pulp; exosomes; mesenchymal stem cells; miRNA; regenerative medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compression stress also stimulates angiogenesis, which is essential for osteoclastogenesis. However, the effects of osteoclastogenesis induced by compression on angiogenesis are poorly understood. In vivo, we found the markers of angiogenesis increased during orthodontic bone remodeling. In vitro, osteoclast-derived exosomes increased proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), as well as expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and CD31. The promotive effects of exosomes derived from compressed osteoclasts were greater than those derived from osteoclasts without compression. Next, we analyzed changes in the microRNA transcriptome after compression stress and focused on microRNA146a-5p (miR-146a), which was significantly decreased by compression. Transfection of an inhibitor of miR-146a stimulated angiogenesis of HUVECs while miR-146a mimics repressed angiogenesis. Adiponectin (ADP) was confirmed to be a target of miR-146a by dual luciferase reporter assay. In HUVECs treated with exosomes, we detected increased ADP which promoted angiogenesis. Knockdown of ADP in HUVECs reduced the promotive effects of exosomes. Our results demonstrate that the decreased miR-146a observed in osteoclasts after compression promotes angiogenesis by targeting ADP, suggesting a novel method to interfere with bone remodeling induced by compression stress.","2022-01","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","151-166","","1","65","","Sci China Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33677819","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33677819","","adiponectin; Adiponectin; angiogenesis; Bone Remodeling; compression stress; exosomes; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; microRNA-146a-5p; Neovascularization, Physiologic; osteoclastogenesis; Osteoclasts; Osteogenesis; Periodontium; Pressure; Tooth Mobility; Tooth Movement Techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The characteristics of the two types of exosomes were not significantly different. Compared to MSCs-Exos, iPSCs-Exos had a better in vitro effect on the proliferation, migration, cell cycle promotion and apoptosis inhibition of human corneal epithelial cells. iPSCs/MSCs-Exos promoted cell regeneration by upregulating cyclin A and CDK2 to drive HCECs to enter the S phase from the G0/G1 phase.

In the present study, i-PDLSCs were extracted from periodontal membrane tissues of patients with severe periodontitis, and in vitro induction with gallic acid (GA) significantly promoted the proliferative activity of i-PDLSCs at a concentration of 10 mM, with TC0 of 11.057 mM and TC50 of 67.56 mM for i-PDLSCs. After mRNA sequencing, we found that GA could alleviate oxidative stress in i-PDLSCs and increase its mitochondrial membrane potential and glucose aerobic metabolism level, thus promoting the osteodifferentiation of i-PDLSCs. After exosomes of i-PDLSCs after GA induction (i-EXO-GA) were isolated by differential centrifugation, we found that 200 ug/mL of i-EXO-GA could remarkably promote the osteodifferentiation of i-PDLSCs. Overall, our results suggest that GA induction can enhance the proliferation and osteodifferentiation in primary cultures of i-PDLSCs in vitro, mediated by alleviating oxidative stress and glycometabolism levels in cells, which further influences the osteodifferentiation-promoting ability of i-EXO-GA.

In this study, we investigated whether the exosomal lncRNA H19 could act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to potentiate osteochondral activity in chondrocytes. METHODS: Dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were carried to verify the interaction between miR-29b-3p and both lncRNA H19 and the target mRNA FoxO3. Chondrocytes were treated with UMSC-derived exosomes, which highly expressing lncRNA H19 expression, followed by apoptosis, migration, senescence, and matrix secretion assessments. An in vivo SD rat cartilage defect model was carried out to explore the role and mechanism of lncRNA H19/miR-29b-3p. RESULTS: UMSCs were successfully identified, and exosomes were successfully extracted. Exosomes exhibited the ability to transfer lncRNA H19 to chondrocytes. Mechanistically, exosomal lncRNA H19 potentiated osteochondral activity by acting as a competing endogenous sponge of miR-29b-3p, and miR-29b-3p directly targeted FoxO3. Intra-articular injection of exosomes overexpressing lncRNA H19 could promote sustained cartilage repair; however, this effect could be undermined by miR-29b-3p agomir. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed a significant role in the development of strategies against cartilage defects for UMSC-derived exosomes that overexpress lncRNA H19. Exosomal H19 was found to promote chondrocyte migration, matrix secretion, apoptosis suppression, as well as senescence suppression, both in vitro and in vivo. The specific mechanism lies in the fact that exosomal H19 acts as a ceRNA against miR-29b-3p to upregulate FoxO3 in chondrocytes.","2021-01","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","e255","","1","11","","Clin Transl Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33463060 PMCID: PMC7805401","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33463060","","Animals; Cells, Cultured; chondrocytes; exosomes; Exosomes; Female; Forkhead Box Protein O3; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; long noncoding RNA; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; MicroRNAs; Osteocytes; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; RNA, Long Noncoding; Signal Transduction; Umbilical Cord; umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, ALP activity has been used to study bone mineralization mechanisms and osteoactive biomaterials among others. The ALP quantification is usually performed by destructive methods either on growing cells or cells lysate in which the osteoconductive biomaterial is being assessed. This work addresses the evaluation of a non-destructive colorimetric approach for the determination of ALP activity on osteoblast-derived exosomes from culture supernatants. The efficiency of the method was evaluated on osteoconductive electrospun scaffolds of PCL compounded with ZnO as a reference biomaterial. The results demonstrated that the osteoblast cell line mineralization induced by osteoconductive scaffolds can be monitorized over time by the non-destructive measurement of ALP activity on osteoblast derived exosomes. Consequently, this non-destructive approach suggested to be a reliable alternative technique for the quantification of biomaterials osteoconductivity or even evaluation of osteoblastic response at stem cells.","2020-10","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","110931","","","115","","Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32600679","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600679","","Alkaline phosphatase; Alkaline Phosphatase; Biomarker; Biomaterial characterization; Bone Development; Bone Regeneration; Bone tissue engineering; Calorimetry; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Line; Culture Media; Exosomes; Humans; Osteoblasts; Osteoblasts cell line","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the exact mechanism of osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs remains unknown, especially the role of exosomes played in. The DPSCs were cultured and received osteogenic induction; then, exosomes from osteogenic-induced DPSCs (OI-DPSC-Ex) at different time intervals were isolated and sequenced for circular RNA (circRNA) expression profiles. Gradually, increased circular lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (circLPAR1) expression was found in the OI-DPSC-Ex coincidentally with the degree of osteogenic differentiation. Meanwhile, results from osteogenic differentiation examinations showed that the OI-DPSC-Ex had osteogenic effect on the recipient homotypic DPSCs. To investigate the mechanism of exosomal circLPAR1 on osteogenic differentiation, we verified that circLPAR1 could competently bind to hsa-miR-31, by eliminating the inhibitory effect of hsa-miR-31 on osteogenesis, therefore promoting osteogenic differentiation of the recipient homotypic DPSCs. Our study showed that exosomal circRNA played an important role in osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs and provided a novel way of utilization of exosomes for the treatment of bone deficiencies.","2020","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","6319395","","","2020","","Biomed Res Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33062690 PMCID: PMC7539105","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33062690","","Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Dental Pulp; Exosomes; Humans; MicroRNAs; Osteogenesis; Receptors, Lysophosphatidic Acid; RNA, Circular; Stem Cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Erythropoietin (EPO) may enhance the beneficial influence of MSCs during recovery from tissue and organ injuries. Microvesicles (MVs) released from MSCs contribute to the restoration of kidney damage. We studied the influence of EPO on MVs derived from MSCs, and the protective effects of these factors in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: The MVs derived from untreated MSCs (MSC-MVs) or from MSCs incubated in different concentrations of EPO (1, 10, 100, and 500 IU/ml EPO-MVs) were used to treat renal injury of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in vivo, and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced fibrosis in a human renal proximal tubular epithelial (HK2) cell line in vitro. Western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses were used to evaluate the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers in the renal tissue and HK2 cells. Flow cytometry was used to assess apoptosis within the HK2 cells, and microRNA (miRNA) microarray assays were used to determine the expression profiles of miRNA in the MSC-MVs and EPO-MVs. RESULTS: Compared to MSC-MVs (untreated), there was a significant increase in the number of EPO-MVs derived from MSCs treated with 1-100 IU/ml EPO, and these EPO-MVs had a greater benefit in UUO mice on days 7 and 14. Moreover, the EPO-MVs had a better restorative effect following TGF-β1-induced fibrosis in HK2 cells at 24 h and 48 h. The flow cytometry results revealed that both types of MVs, especially EPO-MVs, play an important anti-apoptotic role in HK2 cells treated with TGF-β1. The miRNA profiles of the MVs revealed that EPO-MVs changed 212 miRNAs (fold-change ≥ 1.5), including miR-299, miR-499, miR-302, and miRNA-200, and that 70.28 % of these changes involved upregulation. The changed miRNA in EPO-MVs may have contributed to their enhanced protective effects following renal injury compared to MSC-MVs. CONCLUSIONS: There was a dose-dependent increase in the level of EPO-MVs within the range of 1-100 IU/ml EPO. Although both MSC-MVs and EPO-MVs protect the kidney from fibrosis-related damage, there is a superior effect of EPO-MVs.","2015-05-22","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","100","","1","6","","Stem Cell Res Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25998259 PMCID: PMC4469245","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25998259","","Actins; Animals; Apoptosis; Bone Marrow Cells; Cadherins; Cell-Derived Microparticles; Cells, Cultured; Disease Models, Animal; Erythropoietin; Fibrosis; Humans; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Transcriptome; Transforming Growth Factor beta1; Ureteral Obstruction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One is decomposition by lysosomes, and the other is the generation of exosomes that are transported out through the transmembrane. On the other hand, M2 macrophages promote the formation of local vascularization and provide necessary support for the repair of bone defects. To provide a new idea for the treatment of bone defects, the purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of WKYMVm (Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-D-Met-NH2) peptide on the secretion of exosomes from murine bone marrow-derived MSCs (mBMSCs) and the effect of exosomes on the polarization of M2 macrophages. METHODS: The WKYMVm peptide was used to activate the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) pathway in mBMSCs. First, we used Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) to detect the cytotoxic effect of WKYMVm peptide on mBMSCs. Second, we used western blotting (WB) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect the expression of interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) and transcription factor EB (TFEB) in mBMSCs. Then, we detected lysosomal activity using a lysozyme activity assay kit. Third, we used an exosome extraction kit and western blotting to detect the content of exosomes secreted by mBMSCs. Fourth, we used immunofluorescence and western blotting to count the number of polarized M2 macrophages. Finally, we used an inhibitor to block miRNA-146 in exosomes secreted by mBMSCs and counted the number of polarized M2 macrophages. RESULTS: We first found that the WKYMVm peptide had no toxic effect on mBMSCs at a concentration of 1 μmol/L. Second, we found that when the FPR2 pathway was activated by the WKYMVm peptide in mBMSCs, ISG15 and TFEB expression was decreased, leading to increased secretion of exosomes. We also found that lysosomal activity was decreased when the FPR2 pathway was activated by the WKYMVm peptide in mBMSCs. Third, we demonstrated that exosomes secreted by mBMSCs promote the polarization of M2 macrophages. Moreover, all these effects can be blocked by the WRWWWW (WRW4, H-Trp-Arg-Trp-Trp-Trp-Trp-OH) peptide, an inhibitor of the FPR2 pathway. Finally, we confirmed the effect of miRNA-146 in exosomes secreted by mBMSCs on promoting the polarization of M2 macrophages. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated the potential value of the WKYMVm peptide in promoting the secretion of exosomes by mBMSCs and eventually leading to M2 macrophage polarization. We believe that our study could provide a research basis for the clinical treatment of bone defects.","2021-03-03","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","171","","1","16","","J Orthop Surg Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33658070 PMCID: PMC7927268","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33658070","","Animals; Cell Polarity; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Exosomes; FPR2 pathway; M2 macrophages; Macrophages; mBMSCs; Mice; Oligopeptides; Polarization; RAW 264.7 Cells; Receptors, Formyl Peptide; Signal Transduction; WKYMVm peptide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results showed that conditioned medium from PDLSCs under 5d osteogenic induction promoted osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 cells. The exosomes extracted from those conditioned media showed similar effects on osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, exosomes from PDLSCs under 5d of osteogenic induction showed significantly high expression of circ_0000722, compared with exosomes from PDLSCs before osteogenic induction.

The biological effects of exosomes largely depend on cellular origin and physiological status of donor cell. In the present study, we explored the influence of conditioned exosomes from SHED with osteogenic induction on periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) in vitro. Conditioned SHED-Exos from a 3-day osteogenic supernatant were applied during PDLSCs osteogenic differentiation. We found that conditioned SHED-Exos had no cytotoxicity on PDLSCs viability assessed by CCK-8 assay. These SHED-Exos promoted PDLSCs osteogenic differentiation with deep Alizarin red staining, high alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and upregulated osteogenic gene expression (RUNX2, OPN and OCN). We further found BMP/Smad signaling and Wnt/β-catenin were activated by enhanced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and increased nuclear β-catenin protein expression. Inhibiting these two signaling pathways with specific inhibitors (cardamonin and LDN193189) remarkably weakened the enhanced osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, Wnt3a and BMP2 were upregulated in SHED and SHED-Exos. Silencing Wnt3a and BMP2 in SHED-Exos partially counteracts the enhanced osteogenic differentiation. Our findings indicate that conditioned SHED-Exos-enhanced PDLSCs osteogenic differentiation was partly due to its carrying Wnt3a and BMP2. These data provide new insights into the use of SHED-Exos in periodontitis-induced bone defects therapy.","2020","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","1-11","","","111","","Differentiation","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31630077","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630077","","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Exosomes; Humans; Osteogenesis; Osteogenic differentiation; PDLSCs; Periodontal Ligament; SHED-Exos; Stem Cells; Tooth Exfoliation; Tooth, Deciduous; Wnt and BMP signaling pathways; Wnt Signaling Pathway","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The morphology of exosomes was observed by transmission electron microscope, the expression of exosome marker CD63 was detected by Western blot, and the calcium carbonate scaffold was constructed by three chamber parallel automatic temperature control reaction system. According to whether the RUNX2 gene overexpression vector was transfected or not, the complex of BMSCs and calcium carbonate scaffold was divided into three groups, namely BMSCs group, RUNX2 overexpression group and exosome group. The osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was detected by oil red O staining and RT-PCR. There were 9 clean adult healthy male New Zealand white rabbits, aged (12.97±1.21) months, with a body weight of (19.3±3.6) kg, with 3 rabbits in each group. The animal model of skull defect was constructed by surgical method, and the repair of bone defect was evaluated by imaging, he staining and Masson staining. RESULTS: The results of flow cytometry showed that the expression of CD29 protein, CD44 protein, CD11b protein and CD45 protein on the surface of BMSCs were 99.5%, 100%, 0.1% and 0.1%, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the exosomes were bilayer vesicles with a diameter of 50 to 150 nm. Western blot showed that the molecular marker CD63 of exosomes was positive. Oil red O staining showed that the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in exosome group was significantly higher than that in RUNX2 overexpression group and BMSCs group. The results of RT-PCR showed that the relative expressions of RUNX2, BMP-2 and ALP mRNA in BMSCs in exosome group were significantly higher than those in RUNX2 overexpression group and BMSCs group (P<0.05). The imaging results showed that the repair effect of skull defect in exosome group was better than that in RUNX2 overexpression group. HE staining and Masson staining showed that the repair effect of skull defect in exosome group was better than that in RUNX2 overexpression group (P<0.05).

Studies exploring the short external rotator sparing approach are rare. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of standard posterior approach and short external rotator sparing approach. METHODS: This prospective observational study included 126 patients who underwent THA in June 2017-June 2018. Patients were assigned to standard (standard posterior approach) and corrective (short external rotator sparing approach) groups based on the surgical method. Surgical data were recorded postoperatively. Postoperative hip joint recovery was assessed using the times to ambulation and independent stair use, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, Harris score, and Oxford hip score (OHS) at 2 and 8 postoperative weeks. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used for postoperative pain assessment. RESULTS: Postoperative changes of creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin, CRP, and prosthesis position were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). However, intraoperative blood loss (P < 0.001) and postoperative 6-h drainage volume (P = 0.03), hospital stay, blood transfusion rate, and times to ambulation and independent stair use were significantly reduced in the corrective group. Postoperatively, Oxford, and WOMAC scores significantly decreased in both groups. After surgery, the VAS score was more overtly decreased in the corrective group compared with the standard group. CONCLUSIONS: This study concluded that the less invasive short external rotator sparing approach for THA caused less damage, reducing perioperative blood loss, shortening functional recovery time, maintaining prosthesis stability, and improving postoperative pain.","2021-01-11","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","46","","1","16","","J Orthop Surg Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33430904 PMCID: PMC7802290","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33430904","","Aged; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Blood Loss, Surgical; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Organ Sparing Treatments; Osteoarthritis, Hip; Pain, Postoperative; Prospective Studies; Prospective study; Recovery of Function; Short external rotator sparing; Standard approach; Total hip arthroplasty; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: Electron microscopic study of the response of rats to a controlled bone injury, and a randomized controlled study of the effect of IL-1beta administered continuously for three days. METHODS: A standardized defect (1.1 millimeter in diameter, 0.5 millimeter deep) was created unilaterally on the anteromedial surface of the tibia. In some animals, the injury site was recovered five days after operation and processed for ultrastructural evaluation of osteoblasts in the callus. In another group, IL-1beta was delivered to the bone defect using micro-osmotic pumps (0.5 nanograms/hour); control rats received vehicle only. The bones were recovered one to fourteen days after injury, and concentrations of proliferating cells, osteoblasts, and apoptotic bodies were determined. The amount of callus that formed in the defect was measured. RESULTS: Osteoblasts in the callus exhibited ultrastructural changes characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis, including condensation of chromatin, membrane blebbing, formation of apoptotic bodies, and phagocytosis by nearby osteoblasts. Addition of IL-1beta significantly increased the number of osteoblasts at the injury site and significantly decreased the number of apoptotic bodies in relation to the number of osteoblasts. The amount of callus in the bone defect was not affected by IL-1beta treatment. CONCLUSION: The role of programmed cell death of osteoblasts as a normal concomitant of bone healing was confirmed. Evidence was found suggesting that IL-1beta mediated the appearance and disappearance of osteoblasts, possibly by affecting the rates of differentiation and apoptosis, respectively. Understanding these mechanisms conceivably could lead to the ability to control osteoblast levels at an injury site.","1999","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","356-362","","5","13","","J Orthop Trauma","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 10406703","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10406703","","Animals; Apoptosis; Bone and Bones; Disease Models, Animal; Fracture Healing; Fractures, Bone; Interleukin-1; Male; Osteoblasts; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344; Reference Values; Sensitivity and Specificity; Statistics, Nonparametric","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objective was to study whether the consequences of activation of the death program could include feedback control of the healing response. Transforming growth factor beta and interleukin-1beta were delivered together continuously to a standardized tibial defect in rats for 3 days using implanted micro-osmotic pumps. The bones were recovered at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 days after injury (n = 6 in each treated and control group) and concentrations of proliferating cells, osteoblasts and apoptotic bodies were determined. The injury-induced apoptotic component of the healing response was shifted in time due to the combined cytokines, compared with vehicle only, with the result that the peak in the concentration of apoptotic bodies occurred 2-3 days earlier in the treated animals. Neither osteoprogenitor proliferation nor osteoblast concentration was affected by addition of the cytokines. The results suggested that activation of apoptosis during injury repair was not necessarily a passive consequence of the cellular response to injury. Programmed cell death could therefore have an active role in modulating bone repair.","2000-02","2024-01-26 18:51:53","2024-01-26 18:51:53","","89-97","","1","46","","Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 10726975","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10726975","","Animals; Apoptosis; Bony Callus; Cell Division; Interleukin-1; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344; Tibia; Transforming Growth Factor beta","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
